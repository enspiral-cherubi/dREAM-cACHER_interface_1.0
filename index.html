         <p>I was in my old house with my family and all of a sudden a man in Chinese traditional clothing tried to sneak into my room through the window. As soon as I saw this I called my parents and they killed him as if they were spies or ninjas or something. A few seconds later another person tried to get in, but it was a young girl. It’s as if they were sent to kill my family. She came in and we attacked her. I started choking her, but then my mom told me it wasn’t necessary to kill her because she was good (since she wore Kpop socks). Then later we were in a hotel and tons of these ninja-like people were looking for us, and I escaped by walking on the walls and hiding on the ceiling. But later I was found and I was fighting them, when all of a sudden I saw that young girl again. It was wrong to let her go that time. We started fighting and then I can’t remember what happened.", "I remember that I was very relaxed, back at home in New York, on vacation. I was home alone just watching some TV, when suddenly the front door opened. I called out to ask who it was, and when there was no answer, I became nervous. Somehow I knew that it was a stranger--an intruder, and I began to panic. I ran out of the house, and this stranger followed me. It quickly became a chase, in which I had to keep running in order to survive. I found a building, and I ran inside to find some help. I found myself in Annaud, in the middle of a Sleep and Dreams lecture! Dr. Dement was saying names in the Sleep & Dreams lottery, and suddenly my name came up. I found myself unable to move, or to say aloud 'Drowsiness is Red Alert!' and I began to worry that I wouldn't be able to get bonus points and that everyone would think that I was skipping class. I woke myself up, sitting up in bed, screaming the words, DROWSINESS IS RED ALERT!!. I woke up my roommate and we both laughed about it later.", "I don't remember most of the dream except for the end. I was running down a corridor. I kept running and suddenly, something made me collapse. What felt like minutes later, I opened my eyes to see nothing but a three dimensional landscape covered in green. I couldn't move, I was still trapped. But I was no longer in reality. I couldn't feel, I couldn't move, I couldn't hear or touch. All I could do was watch. Then, the layers of green began to slowly peel off. I was back in reality again, but time was escaping away from me. It was as though for every second the real world traveled, I only traveled half of a second. The world was running away from me through time. But then, the peeling continued, but much faster. I was 'peeling' through microseconds of time, frame-by-frame. Slowly but surely, we eventually caught up to reality. I could breathe again, but I still couldn't move faster than the peeling. Then, I slowly got up, but I could still feel as though I was travelling through time, not through space itself. Time was a constricting factor, and it felt as though I was in playdo or goo of some sort, moving only forward as behind me was filled. There was only one possible path. Then, I felt my roommate pulling me out of the playdough and I awoke, alone in my bed.", "Every now and then I have a nightmare in which I am running away from someone following me. It happened again last night. Apparently, this person has malicious intentions since I am filled with anxiety as soon as I realize I am in this situation. I try to run as fast as I can but my legs feel heavy and I have trouble breathing. Also, I try yelling my mother's name as I run but for some reason I cannot seem to get any words out or the cries for help get drowned by gasps for air. The anxiety increases throughout the dream as my efforts to escape or get help seem futile until I finally wake up.", "In this dream I awoke at a hotel and for some reason I was traveling downstairs to ask my parents a question. They were in the pool area on the first floor but once I got down to them (via stairs) I realized that I had forgotten something. I don't know what I had forgotten but I knew I had to return to my room. On the way back up to my room on the 12th floor I took the elevator. Why I didn't take it down I don't know. Inside the elevator was an operator and a little kid sitting on a bench. In the middle of the elevator there was a large dial that resembled a clock and the operator told me that I had to visualize in my mind the floor I wanted to go to in order to get there. I thought about the number 12 and saw the hand on the clock move toward it but it wouldn't quite get there. Then I noticed that on the clock face were the words moon base and I immediately started thinking about that. As that happened the elevator took off through the roof of the building and starting hurtling through space. The operator had disappeared and just me and the kid remained. The elevator soon went to and we were somehow breathing in space as we went toward the moon. The little kid then transformed into a bird like creature and protected us from a hail of comets, alarm clock.", "This dream was interesting to me because I still remember it very well. Some of my friends I have now and I had decided we wanted to go camping for our upcoming vacation, so we set off to a hilly region nearby where we live. Before I know it, however, I am no longer sitting comfortably in the passenger seat of my car, but am in the bed of a forest green pick-up truck driven by the dad of a friend I have not seen in eight years! And now we are no longer near the destination I thought we were going to, but are racing at the speed of a fast roller coaster up the side of a hill which has, the higher we went, turned into a lush green mountain a la Machu Picchu in the Peruvian highlands. As the truck speeds up, the gradient of the dirt road on the side of the mountain is increasing until we are practically traveling vertically such that I am bouncing around the back of the pickup truck and am afraid of flailing out of it and smashing onto the wooded ground thousands of feet below. Despite all this chaos, the dream took an unexpected turn: we reached the summit of the hill/mountain/thing and it looked like a plateau. And on the plateau was a piano. I was standing in a circle of people around the piano, and became immediately aware that one person at a time from the circle had to play the piano and sing a song to audition for a part in some production which my brain failed to specify. So, when my turn came up, I played a OneRepublic song which was still in my head for an hour after I woke up. The end.</p>
