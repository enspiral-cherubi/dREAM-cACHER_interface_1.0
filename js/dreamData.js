  "I was in my old house with my family and all of a sudden a man in Chinese traditional clothing tried to sneak into my room through the window. As soon as I saw this I called my parents and they killed him as if they were spies or ninjas or something. A few seconds later another person tried to get in, but it was a young girl. It’s as if they were sent to kill my family. She came in and we attacked her. I started choking her, but then my mom told me it wasn’t necessary to kill her because she was good (since she wore Kpop socks). Then later we were in a hotel and tons of these ninja-like people were looking for us, and I escaped by walking on the walls and hiding on the ceiling. But later I was found and I was fighting them, when all of a sudden I saw that young girl again. It was wrong to let her go that time. We started fighting and then I can’t remember what happened.", "I remember that I was very relaxed, back at home in New York, on vacation. I was home alone just watching some TV, when suddenly the front door opened. I called out to ask who it was, and when there was no answer, I became nervous. Somehow I knew that it was a stranger--an intruder, and I began to panic. I ran out of the house, and this stranger followed me. It quickly became a chase, in which I had to keep running in order to survive. I found a building, and I ran inside to find some help. I found myself in Annaud, in the middle of a Sleep and Dreams lecture! Dr. Dement was saying names in the Sleep & Dreams lottery, and suddenly my name came up. I found myself unable to move, or to say aloud 'Drowsiness is Red Alert!' and I began to worry that I wouldn't be able to get bonus points and that everyone would think that I was skipping class. I woke myself up, sitting up in bed, screaming the words, DROWSINESS IS RED ALERT!!. I woke up my roommate and we both laughed about it later.", "I don't remember most of the dream except for the end. I was running down a corridor. I kept running and suddenly, something made me collapse. What felt like minutes later, I opened my eyes to see nothing but a three dimensional landscape covered in green. I couldn't move, I was still trapped. But I was no longer in reality. I couldn't feel, I couldn't move, I couldn't hear or touch. All I could do was watch. Then, the layers of green began to slowly peel off. I was back in reality again, but time was escaping away from me. It was as though for every second the real world traveled, I only traveled half of a second. The world was running away from me through time. But then, the peeling continued, but much faster. I was 'peeling' through microseconds of time, frame-by-frame. Slowly but surely, we eventually caught up to reality. I could breathe again, but I still couldn't move faster than the peeling. Then, I slowly got up, but I could still feel as though I was travelling through time, not through space itself. Time was a constricting factor, and it felt as though I was in playdo or goo of some sort, moving only forward as behind me was filled. There was only one possible path. Then, I felt my roommate pulling me out of the playdough and I awoke, alone in my bed.", "Every now and then I have a nightmare in which I am running away from someone following me. It happened again last night. Apparently, this person has malicious intentions since I am filled with anxiety as soon as I realize I am in this situation. I try to run as fast as I can but my legs feel heavy and I have trouble breathing. Also, I try yelling my mother's name as I run but for some reason I cannot seem to get any words out or the cries for help get drowned by gasps for air. The anxiety increases throughout the dream as my efforts to escape or get help seem futile until I finally wake up.", "In this dream I awoke at a hotel and for some reason I was traveling downstairs to ask my parents a question. They were in the pool area on the first floor but once I got down to them (via stairs) I realized that I had forgotten something. I don't know what I had forgotten but I knew I had to return to my room. On the way back up to my room on the 12th floor I took the elevator. Why I didn't take it down I don't know. Inside the elevator was an operator and a little kid sitting on a bench. In the middle of the elevator there was a large dial that resembled a clock and the operator told me that I had to visualize in my mind the floor I wanted to go to in order to get there. I thought about the number 12 and saw the hand on the clock move toward it but it wouldn't quite get there. Then I noticed that on the clock face were the words moon base and I immediately started thinking about that. As that happened the elevator took off through the roof of the building and starting hurtling through space. The operator had disappeared and just me and the kid remained. The elevator soon went to and we were somehow breathing in space as we went toward the moon. The little kid then transformed into a bird like creature and protected us from a hail of comets, alarm clock.", "This dream was interesting to me because I still remember it very well. Some of my friends I have now and I had decided we wanted to go camping for our upcoming vacation, so we set off to a hilly region nearby where we live. Before I know it, however, I am no longer sitting comfortably in the passenger seat of my car, but am in the bed of a forest green pick-up truck driven by the dad of a friend I have not seen in eight years! And now we are no longer near the destination I thought we were going to, but are racing at the speed of a fast roller coaster up the side of a hill which has, the higher we went, turned into a lush green mountain a la Machu Picchu in the Peruvian highlands. As the truck speeds up, the gradient of the dirt road on the side of the mountain is increasing until we are practically traveling vertically such that I am bouncing around the back of the pickup truck and am afraid of flailing out of it and smashing onto the wooded ground thousands of feet below. Despite all this chaos, the dream took an unexpected turn: we reached the summit of the hill/mountain/thing and it looked like a plateau. And on the plateau was a piano. I was standing in a circle of people around the piano, and became immediately aware that one person at a time from the circle had to play the piano and sing a song to audition for a part in some production which my brain failed to specify. So, when my turn came up, I played a OneRepublic song which was still in my head for an hour after I woke up. The end.", "Last night, I had the most vivid dream of participating in a Mario Kart race. No, I wasn't Yoshi or Mario or Bowser driving the kart; I was the kart itself, racing past competitors towards the finish. Like the other vehicles, I was a car with an attitude. I would laugh as cars in front of me were hit with red shells, and I would feel gleefully triumphant when one of my bananas caused someone to fall off the course. Ouch! The pain of getting struck by a lightning bolt! Not only did I feel the excruciating zap spreading all throughout my body, but I also experienced the awkward feeling of being shrunken into a miniscule version of myself. Attempting to escape from being assaulted by more weapons, I begged my driver to drive less like a maniac and more like a conscientious human. Unfortunately, he did not heed my pleas for safety. As his driving became more and more erratic, it seemed like he was ATTEMPTING to hit obstacles in the way. As we rammed into a particularly giant Bowser shell, I found myself flipping forwards off the track and into the depths below.", "This is the most vivid dream I recall and wrote completely. I was at a friend’s birthday party. However, this party was taking place in another school that I had visited a few times for competitions. I do recall the name of the friend whose birthday it was, but for privacy reasons, I shall not state it. Few of my favorite teachers were also there such as my math lab instructor and HOD, computer science. There was a race and for some reason a few friends of mine went in the wrong direction. I thought I had won the race but it turned out I had to cross the finish line holding a sponge. I had to go back and I saw this white stall in the middle of a very green field with sponges. The stall owned refused to give me a sponge and I had to deposit my scarf (which is weird since I never wear scarves) to get the sponge. Knowing that I wasn’t about to win, I decided to just throw my sponge over the finish line, but someone saw me and I had to confess and I lost. I started walking towards the restroom. It was a huge restroom- not like the dirty restrooms that are present in schools- more like a hotel restroom. I was staring at myself in the mirror and I noticed something disgusting on my sweater and I started feeling really bad because everybody in the party must have seen my dirty sweater. While I was emptying my bladder, a girl entered the restroom. She looked 7 years or so with very tiny with unbelievably scary eyes and wrinkled face. I still shiver picturing her in my head. She came close to me and asked me “Where is the restroom?” I told her that she was in the restroom and she smiled and said “Ok” in the creepiest falsetto possible. I remembered that she was a girl and shouldn’t be in the men’s restroom and I ran out. However, I wasn’t in the field anymore, I was in my own school building- I clearly remember the color of the walls and am certain I was in my own school. I scream for help and people come near me and I tell them what happens but nobody believed me. I see her running and I try to follow her. Suddenly, she has disappeared and there’s this wide gap between where I’m standing and the place ahead of me.", "I had a dream a few weeks before I found out that I was pregnant. It was extremely vivid that when I started feeling nauseated my husband decided to buy a test. I'll explain that later but back to the dream. I woke up in my dream took the test and it came back positive. I told my husband congratulations you're going to be a dad in my dream. Well later down the road we go to the doctor and found out that I was having twins. My husband faints and I wake up from the dream. Well I told him about the dream so he decided that I should take a test. I didn't know what test he picked up but the exact test he picked up in real life was the exact one I used in my dream!!! I told him that and now we are just hoping the second half of my dream doesn't come true. We will love them both the same if it does its just scary you know. And what makes it more real is that people around me are thinking that I could be pregnant with twins. Oh, i am suppose to be eight weeks pregnant as i am typing this, go for an ultrasound in couple of days so i will know then. So to anyone trying to figure out a dream good luck and sometimes it can come true!!", "This dream was one that I used to have a lot when I was younger. Ive had it about 7 times and each time its just as terrifying as the first. I would have it whenever I was sick and had a high fever. In this dream, i cant really see anything except this tiny particle of energy. I cant look directly at it and I feel like its very powerful. My body is not present, as if i'm not physically there. I'm stuck looking at this thing that seems to grow bigger and get more detailed. as its doing so, it feels as if im being tortured mentally. I cant move or look away, so im forced to watch this thing that started as something microscopic turn into this huge overwhelming force. I hear a white noise like a clock ticking and every second feels like a thousand years. I feel helpless and amazed at what is happening. The more detailed the object gets, the scarier it looks. This dream is very hard to explain and i havent had it for years. But the crazy thing is ive asked 2 other people about this dream and they can recall having the same exact dream. These people say its the hardest dream to remember but it makes a huge impact on them.", "I've heard that many people have flying dreams, nighttime visions of soaring through the sky like some kind of superhero or magical human-bird; however, I doubt that the majority of those people have flying dreams akin to mine - ones that are often more frustrating than enjoyable. This type of dream is a recurring one for me. Every few weeks or so, it will pop up in my nighttime mind. I can't decide whether I look forward to it or not, but regardless of my wishes, it's with me for good it seems. The dream always begins with me speeding across the sky. The landscape below often differs, but the one that appears most often and did so most recently closely resembles that of seaside cliffs. Flying through the air, skimming the water as a weightless, human airplane, there's nothing I would rather be doing. It feels incredible to have the wind rushing in my face and to watch the earth pass by below me. However, it never lasts. For some idiotic reason that I can never quite grasp, I land, touching down smoothly onto those cliffs above the water. As soon as my feet come to rest on solid ground, I want to become airborne again, to feel those glorious sensations some more. However (and here's the frustrating part), no matter how hard I try or what I do, I simply can't take off again. The rest of the dream is generally spent doing increasingly desperate acts to get back in the air (ie. running at top speed with my arms spread wide like some crazed flightless bird, lying flat on my stomach on the ground, waiting to take off like an airplane, and eventually repeatedly jumping off the cliffs and climbing back up to try again). Maybe one of these nights, I'll figure out the trick to getting back among the clouds and be able to have flying dreams like a normal person. At least that's the plan.", "My dream begins with me and my brother standing outside of an extremely well protected house. The house was guarded by a tall chain link fence and behind it were lots of lions and bushes that were the same colors as the lions. We jumped over the fence, ran past the lions, jumped over another fence and managed to get into the house. (I don't remember what we did in the house or what our objective was). The next thing I know is that we are running away from the bad guys and escape the way we returned. After jumping over the first fence it was as if we were in water because we swam through the area where the lions were but this time they were gone. The men chased us into the city and in particular I remember running down the walls of a building to escape from a man who had blonde, slicked back, and who wore dark sunglasses and a leather jacket. We managed to get away and I hid in a group of people in a bakery. The man walked in and looked around and he looked at me but didn't recognize me so he left. I didn't know how or why he didn't recognize me because I could have sworn he looked directly at me. After that I left my physical body to look at myself in order to see why he didn't recognize me and I saw myself as a complete stranger with dark, oddly cut hair and with a bruise on my face.", "Last night I dreamt that the world was coming to an end. I looked this up on various sites and generally it is interpreted as the dreamer being under a great amount of stress. I'm putting this question to you because a) I don't feel under a great amount of stress and b) it wasn't a stressful dream. From as much as I can remember, the sea/water figured a lot in this dream. I grew up by the sea,and I now live on an island city. There was some sort of earthquake type disturbance, and people were shook (there were people all around me at all times, and this kind of gave the scenario a NORMAL feel as opposed to some dreams I have had where I am on my own, and that feels like a time bomb ticking). Then we looked up into the sky and could see meteors/balls of fire slowly coming down from the sky, and that's when I knew this was the end of the world. I don't believe this dream simply signifies how stressed I am. First of all, I am from a religious denomination that accepts, believes in and awaits the end of the world - we believe it could happen any time, only God knows. Secondly, the dream itself wasn't jarring or nightmarish. I have had nightmares and jarring dreams before, this wasn't one of them. Thirdly, I am currently in between jobs and as a result I have to be careful about spending money and quickly finding a new job, but I am not stressed out about it. I believe in giving out and attracting positive vibes to oneself and that's what I have been doing about my unemployment The reason I am curious about this dream (apart from showing the end of the world) is that I am an active dreamer. I am one of those people who gets recurring dreams and nightmares and over the years I have seen familiar places, people, situations in my dreams and I have grown through them and even dealt with some of the more stressful dreams that I used to keep having. This was not one of them. Although when I usually have dreams where we are walking around vast empty buildings, I inevitably dream of either my childhood house or my high school, these places didn't figure in this dream. The only other thing I remember from the dream is a damaged rose bush.", "You know. They say theres a meaning for all your dreams. Well for me I cant actually put my finger on mine. But i do understand one thing im thankful for it. I started having these dreams 3 months ago. In the first dream I was standing in my front yard , i can remember everything. The sounds the smell the glow of the sun ,it was so vivid. But that changed fast when I saw a huge black dog. I remember the fear washing through me. I didnt run , i just stood there. So it charged me. It was about 5 feet away when i got knocked sideways. Now in my regular dreams the people i see such as family memembers are kinda like ghost. Their there i can see them but i cant actually feel their presence. This was different. When they knocked me sideways i practically felt the heat coming off their body. But thing is i dont remember their face. So the dreams continued. Everytime i dream im about to be hurt or somthing bad is going to happen THEIR there. I can never see their face its like a blur. I would give anything to understand what the meaning of these are. Are they real ? Or a stranger of my mind.", "I was riding in a high shopping cart with some friends, racing. The road looked similar to one of the roads on the way to Mt. Hood Village. On one side there was a very large steep hill, covered by a forest. On the left side, there was a downward slopping hill, equally steep, covered by forest. I was loosing speed and my friends started leaving without me. I began to panic and the cart I was in swerved off to the side and tipped over as one of the wheels slipped off the road. I toppled out of the cart and started rolling down the hill. When I was on the road all the trees had been deep green pine trees. When I rolled down the hill, the ground was covered in crunchy autumn leaves. when I reached the bottom, I got scared to be away from my friends, but I looked around. I saw small animal bones on the ground. I became more scared and continued to look around to see where I was and saw something that truly terrified me. I don't remember if I had seen Satan himself, or just the severed goat head... Or maybe a goat skull. I don't remember, but I was so scared I thought I might die of fright.", "I was standing on an empty dirt road. There was grass all around and on the left side was a very steep grassy hill with a forest toward the bottom. I was talking happily to my two best friends, Amy and Shelby, when I took a step back and my foot slipped off the dirt road causing me to stumble. I tumbled down the hill, a little afraid. I ended up tumbling through the forest. Before I stopped rolling I somehow went into a blue house in the middle of the forest. I think one of the walls of the house was missing for me to roll into it. I got up and thought Amy and Shelby would be looking for me but I decided I didn't want to be found. I started looking around and went to walk around the house. The house was sitting in a huge clearing. There was a shallow stream surrounding the house like a moat. A little bridge went over the stream and there was still a good distance of grass beyond it before the clearing ended. I believe the great white wolf that I saw there may have been god. He never spoke, but I understood anyway... There were no words or voices in my head but I knew what he wanted anyway. When I first saw him, I was scared and thought to run away. Then he looked at me and I realized he wasn't an ordinary wolf. He didn't want to be afraid and he didn't run at me. I somehow knew that the house I had rolled into belonged to him. He looked at me and I felt like he had asked me to walk with him, but I didn't hear words, he made no sound. I just knew he had asked me without asking me. I walked with him around the house. I felt like we had made small talk without speaking, until two boys started down the hill and toward the clearing. (I find it slightly odd that it's 2 males, because I have nightmares often and most of the time I'm being chased by 2 random men.) My first thought was that it was Amy and Shelby but looking again, I realized that I did not recognize them and they were both definitely boys. I stood still but the wolf looked at me again and toward a boulder near the edge of the stream. I knew what he wanted, so I ducked down and hide myself from the boys behind the boulder. The wolf ran for the first time since I had seen him. He ran toward the two boys, barking. I watched as the boys turned to run back up the hill, scared with the wolf right at their heels. I felt that I knew the wolf would have caught up to them with no problem and ripped them apart, but the wolf didn't want to hurt them, he just wanted them out of his forest. When he finished with the boys, he walked back over the small bridge and came to get me. I hadn't moved from my hiding spot until he came for me. We went back into the house and there, everything gets fuzzy. I don't remember seeing the wolf again, but he had a human maid that had not been there before. I looked through the fridge, feeling hungry and his maid gave me a piece of cheesecake, my favorite dessert.", "SO last nihgt ive been having this wierd dream for almost a month now . I dream bout this tall handsome guy buh i can't see his face at all. He gives me everything i want anything i want im super rich i have a power. Buh then hegoes in this dark room and sits here in silence . Then again hes giving love to me he tells me never let me go i love you . i say i wont let you go.

It took me a few minutes to realize no one was in the room with me, not even my husband, Sam. I was breathing hard, and my body was trembling. I’ve had many dreams about my son Jeff before, but none of them had ever before been so vivid. His image was so clear; I felt like I could reach out and touch him. He and his best friend, Mark, were about ten years old in this dream. I knew, because Jeff had a full head of dark brown curly hair, and he was wearing a yellow shirt with his image on it, and Mark had not yet started to sprout up to his six-foot height. At ten, Jeff was in remission from leukemia and his hair had come back after falling out during chemotherapy. I rose from my bed and went into the bathroom, still shaking. It had been 30 years since Jeff died of leukemia, and five years since his best friend Mark joined him, dying of lymphoma. I said to myself, “It was only a dream. Pull yourself back together; you have a big week ahead. Your darling granddaughters are coming to visit--if you haven’t botched things up with your impatience and big mouth.” For some reason, I was really nervous about the eight- and ten-year-old girls--the daughters of my son Mike--flying by themselves. As I slipped into a pair of jeans and a tee shirt, I couldn’t get the image of Mark and Jeff out of my head. I was surprised that my cat, Tyrone, wasn’t pawing me and meowing for his breakfast. I glanced at the clock on my nightstand. It said 6:33 a.m. I thought, “There goes my one morning to sleep in.” My husband, Sam, was on a bike trip, and I had been dreaming of sleeping in until at least 9 a.m. “Oh, well, I’m wide awake, might as well go downstairs and make coffee,” I thought. I was trying to calm myself, as I was still shaking from the dream. I went down to the kitchen, still wondering about the whereabouts of the cat. I called “Tyrone, Tyrone,” while searching for him. He was nowhere in the house, but I saw movement out the patio door. I walked out to the patio, and stopped cold. I felt the blood drain from my face as I gazed upon my son Jeff, and his best friend Mark. Two little ten year-old-boys were standing with their arms folded and their faces in angry scowls. Jeff approached me and said, “Why did you call us here? This is not our home.” Then Mark said, “This is not Glenwood!” Glenwood was the town we lived in long ago, when Jeff and Mark were young boys. I felt my head and my arms to see if I was real. “I must still be dreaming,” I said to myself. I reached out to touch Jeff, but my hand went right through his body. I tried to scream, but I had no mouth. Suddenly I heard barking. I looked up and saw Charlie, Jeff and Mike’s long-dead collie, flying around the house. Mark pointed to my cat who was under the patio chair, shaking like a leaf. Mark said, “Charlie can’t come to help us while the cat is here. In an accusing tone Jeff said, “Put the cat in the house. If this was Glenwood you would have a collie, not a cat.” As soon as I put Tyrone in the house Charlie, with his full shining brown and white coat, came down and rubbed his nose next to my leg. Tears were streaming down my face. Then Jeff said, “We don’t have much time here. Why did you call us?” “I need you to make sure my granddaughters arrive from Tucson safely--and that their father forgives me for the time I didn’t spend with him while you were sick.” The two little boys broke out in mischievous smiles, and they shouted, “Come on Charlie. We need to pay a visit to Mike!” As the three images faded, I heard Mark say “We need to stop in Glenwood first. There are no fireworks here!” The Fourth of July was approaching, and Mark always managed to have his own great fireworks in Glenwood. Later that day, my granddaughters arrived at the airport safely. With the help of two ten-year-old boys, I’m sure.", "I had a dream mostly related to Harry Potter. Hagrid is no longer teaching Care of Magical Creatures because Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the run and so nobody takes his lessons any more. Because of this, he has a lot of free time, so he draws pictures dedicated to Harry nine times a day. He ended up with some very impressive pictures featuring glass goblets of red wine, with crooked stems, and stony grey masks. The pictures were mostly oil on canvas or acrylic on art-block paper, with white splotches sprayed dramatically over the objects and background, which were painted first. It seemed like he had painted the same objects over and over again at different angles and perspectives for each painting.", "a little bit of back round knowledge: when i was about 8(im fourteen now) i was always terrified of a few things.. 1. the man on the moon, 2. rocky and bowinkle the moose, and third, those scary weird pop up pranks on the computer. please if you know whats going on. let me know. My dreams have always been intense. ive always have woken up with chills or sleep terrors looking around my room like somethings wrong. still visualizing the outlines of the intense figures and patterns that were in my dream. this time it went way to far. when im in a realy deep sleep and its hard for me to wake up. my dream traps me inside. and scares the living hell out of me. i will try and try to get out, but it will trick me, like when ill have a bad dream and wake up and go to turn my light on, it wont turn on. thats when i realize im sucked into my dream and that i need to make a worth while and try to hold through so that i can get out. my mind plays me over and over again, keeping me sleep terrors but i can feel the chills and goosebumps in my dreams.. and this time it was weird and messed up.. imagine you flying.. and in mid air a giant white man on the moon starts calmly yelling at you. your heart starts racing so fast that you fall down. then you wake up in somethings arms.. you open your eyes very slowly and its bowinkle staring straight at you not talking. now pretend you wake up again this time in your bed where you had fallen asleep. you go down stairs to get something.. on your way up already a bit frightened of the basement, something pulls you down and you fall for three hours straight before you finally smack face first into the ground you wake up.. again.. terrified.. go to turn on your light and tv as an indicator that your not in your dream.. nothing turns on, no one is home. you feel like your heart has been shattered from beating so fast and your chest incaves into your terrified body.. you kick open the door, run outside, and begin to run.. youve never felt your heart beat faster in your whole life time. you are scared and afraid and dont know what to do so you begin to run down your block jumping higher and higher with each leap. finally your flying over a nearby sod farm local to your house.. you fall again as you hit the ground you close your eyes open.. and know your in a boat with no oars in the middle of a lake.. you see a small paper plane fly across it and open it up into an exorcist face. you break down in tears. finally you wake up. this was my dream. after i woke up i immediately sat up the up half of my body, with an anxiety attack, i started crying my eyes out. bawling. i tried picking up my legs it didnt work.. screaming.. AH NOT THIS NOTHIS GAIN NO thinking im still in a dream. finally my legs started moving.. as i went to reach for a light i had fallen down and started spazzing out on the floor, tried to indicate it. i blacked out after the spasm. woke up on my floor whhere it had occured.. i sat in my bed not wanting to fall asleep just crying for three ours straight until finally the sun came up.. i had made it. this was three days ago. im in need of some sort of information, explanation, or assistance. like i said if you know whats going on. let me know.", "I was in my brothers bedroom when i heard a clicking sound. I knew something bad was about to happen. So i ran out of the room The clicking sound went faster when i was running out of the room I ran into the living room and put my back against the door. The clicking stopped and I heard something coming out of the computer It was a Monster that had a pigs head and a mans body. it had crop circles and it did not have a long snout. It was brown and hairy. It was so ugly i keep having images of it in my mind when im in bed. it creeped my out. I saw its face poking out of the door then the dream ended.", "I was in my living room when these toys came alive They were singing. Then heard the door of the living room ope Out of the black came the pig monster Guess what i did next I hugged it! Then other monsters came through the door Then the dream ended.", "About a month ago, I had a very odd dream. Most of my dreams make sense and usally I can get a feel for what there saying. But this one just made me go Wtf just happened?. Anyway, I was in this big snowie field. Near the edge of this feild was a tree trunk, with no leaves on it, and a sort of small door way on the bottom of it. I was inside that doorway, crouching inside the tree. I was stuck, I could not move at all. A friend came to me and asked if I wanted to comeout and go with him to a store, and I said nah, maybe another time and he walked away. After a while of sitting, I got up and decided to see what was outside, and what I saw was odd. On one of the four edges of the snowy feild, there was a mall with a lot of people I knew. They were telling me to come with them, but I ignored them and crawled back into the tree. After that, I woke up.", "I was infront of this fancy restraunt. All of my familly were inside, and I was outside. We were there for some sort of celebration. I was standing outside with my hands in my pocket when I randomly thought Giant floating banana!. I dont know why this thought occured, but when I looked to my left, sure enough there was a giant floating banana. At first I was li Oh hey, a floating banana! I always wanted to see one. Then ignored it. Then 5 secs lator I looked at it again and said Wait a min... there is no thing as a giant floating banana... so this must be a dream! I then lost ludicity... but regained it while sitting in the restraunt on a chair. Then I said Man, when am I going to wake up from this dre- Then I woke up.", "So, I was on one team (it seemed we were the good guys) Me and my partner were both wearing super hero costumes. Mine was blue and yellow and really shiny. My partner had a really shiny suit as well, but her whole outfit was a chocolate brown. Her hair was brown and puffy and worn in pigtails. Her cape was brown and mine was blue. Anyways, we apparently had powers because my team mate had the ability to shoot melted chocolate out of her hands. When I attacked, giant fuzzy dice came out of my palms. We were fighting with this other guy who also had a shiny suit which was black and white, but he didn't have a cape. His power was electricity. We were running around chasing after him whilst attacking while he was trying to shoot electricity at us. The floor was a giant monopoly board. I don't really know how this was the Olypmics... but in the dream we knew it was, so.. Oh well. The dream faded when I looked up to the far side of the arena to look at the spectators cheering.", "I was at the beach with my daughter and my best friend. i was sitting at a picnic table rite up against the water line. i was watching them playing around in the water but it was between me and the life gaurd/security shack.it was like a tiny little mirage, a little ocean of thier own. i decided to join them but before i did i picked up my daughters shoes and her glasses and placed them on the table along with my own shoes and started walking tword them.but i got lost, i could no longer see them. every thing was a blurr like i was starting to loose my vision. i wondered for what seemed like hours. i finally just by accident ran into the security shack where there was a female ranger type person. i was begging her for help but she was not verry friendly. i told her i was lost , that i was looking for my daughter and my friend but i could'nt see and i came with my mother that she had drove us and was waiting in her truck in the parking lot. she did help me find my mother and when i found her she would not help me. she just sat there. i started out to find them again on my own. i was wondering all over the place. i traveled for miles . my vision getting worse. i now somehow ended up in the hills . it was like a verry rural area on a verry deselate little dirt road that seemed more like a dirt path than a road really. i was franticly looking for someone to help me. i passed several tiny little houses until i finally stoped at one ( but now i was in my car ) i pulled up at an angle and began pounding on the door. it was a little green duplex. a verry old black woman opened the door. she let me in and i was explaing i was lost and could not find my daughter and my friend and how i was loosing my vision. i explained i could see her but only an outline. i could tell she was wearing a dress and i could see her hair arond her head but i could not see her face. it was just a brown oval shape under her hair. we were talking and her son walked in. i was startled , there was something about him that just didnt seem rite. he said he would help me but he wanted toget cleaned up first, he was in his work clothes i waited but when he was done he layed down on th couch and covered up with a blanket and told me to wait he was tired . this scared me so i left and strated running down this little road but i couldnt tell wich direction i was going. i stopped at several more houses but no one answered the door. i came up on a big farm and had to make my way through a huge plowed field and when i reached this big old barn there was a man there and i could tell he wanted to just hurt me so i ran. i ran and i ran. i stoped at another house , no one answered so i just went in hopeing to find something to protect myself with. i found something but i cant remember exactly what it was and i began to run again hopeing to find help and reunite with my loved ones. i saw another house and there was a verry tall man getting into his car. it was a little shiny blue volkswagon. he could tell i was frantic and needed help but he just continued to get in his car and drive away. i was devistated and had been running for hours and hours and hours without stopping. after he drove away i knocked on the door and a little boy opened it. i thought finally ! someone will help me. he went to get his mother but when he returned she was not with him. he said she said to come in and she would help me so i went in and she was lying on the couch completly covered up in a blanket and did not say a word. the boy went up stairs like i wasnt even there. this house was frightning. the living room where his mother was lying was so tiny barely the size of a closet , it was extremely old. it had red velvet on the walls. i was so scared, i ran into the kitchen which was hard to find the house was like a maze. i found a drawer and found what i thought was a small yellow flashlight and wound myself back to the door and started running again. i turned on the flashlight but it was not a flashlight , whe i pushed up on the switch it produced a flame. i keep looking behind me to make sure the two men were not behind me. i just wanted to get help. the last thing i remember is i saw a store in the distance it was lit up with yellow lights i ran and ran i had such hope now that i had finally found help and would be safe. just as i was reaching the parking lot the lights went out but there were people still getting in there cars. i was looking for roger ( my husband ) i felt like he was there i felt saved but they told me he didnt make it . that he had died. roger has been sick going on two years now with stage 4 kidney cancer. the last thing i remember is being put into an ambulance and driving away. i dont know if i made it or if i died......................", "A while back I had a dream that left me rushing for air when I woke up. When I fell asleep I could hear myself running. I could feel the wind rushing past my face and the ground beneath my feet as I ran full force. I knew I was in a wooded area because of the shuffling leaves and the twigs snapping beneath my feet. The worst part was that the whole time I was blind. I couldn't see anything around me but all of my other senses were heightened. The dream got really intense because I started to run faster and I could hear myself breathing harder and harder. That lasted for about two seconds when out of nowhere I just fell. I fell over a cliff or into a hole or something very large because I just kept falling until I woke up gasping for air. It was one of the most intense dreams I have ever had in my life.", "I wasn't myself in this dream; I was about seven years old. I was standing at the edge of a baseball field watching a team of high schoolers play. i was with two other people, a girl and a boy, both also high-schoolers. Eventually, the baseball players noticed me, and they knew I was a vampire. I discovered this fact as a dreamer when the girl and boy told me to run. I became cornered against a building with a brick wall. It was at this point that I realized I was dreaming. Because I was a vampire, naturally I could fly, so I did just that into a broken window on the building. When I entered the building, my vampire coven said I wasn't welcome there and threatened to also kill me. I quickly escaped outside, where I was cornered once again by the baseball team and now my former family. A familiar man (he either was a former dream character or long-forgotten person in my waking life) came to me and said he was my knight. He was about 27-32 years old. I had gone a long time without blood and was becoming weak, so he offered up his. I was hesitant at first, but I knew I wouldn't escape without it, so I bit his neck. The taste of blood, salty and metallic and delicious, filled my mouth. Rejuvenated, I escaped, thanking the man. We seemed to know each other on a very personal level, as if he knew some deep, dark secret about myself. I suspect he is secretly my subconscious. That sneaky fellow appears a lot in my dreams (the subconscious, not the actual man). Well, at this point I woke up since the blood experience was too elating for me to handle, I guess. This dream has left a huge impression on me just by the sheer amount of emotions I felt during it. Content, terrified, relieved, strangely depressed, and euphoric.", "In my dream I was allowed into a flight tower at an airport. I went inside and was allows to go to the top floor via an elevator. I saw out and it was a nice view. I don't remember anymore of that. But in week or so I went to the local airport and was allowed into the flight tower and I went to both the radar room and the top floor via elevator. The view was of the city skyline and it was really cool. I wanted to run down 20 floors worth of stairs but couldn't. Did I see my future?", "My dreams are always similar as i find my self in this grey room and in the middle of the floor is a person strapped to a table. i find that if i try to move or speak nothing happens like you whole body is numb then this man walks in wearing a white coat but has no face in fact never have i seen a face in my dream. well as he walks over he picks up this scalpel and slowly cuts the mans eye out at this point i was panicking thinking if i was next because the guy was screaming in pain. after some more amputation (ill try not to be graphic) he slowly walks over to me covered in red with this metal blade in his hand reflecting off some kind of light. i was trying so hard to scream but nothing was happening as he got close someone whispered my name in like a ghostly voice defiantly a feminine and then i wake up sweating. This one time and i remember it all to clearly well it all rolled out in the similar way the grey room and no movement/voice however i was closer much closer to this person strapped in a chair the guy in white was near me and he was using some sort of old device on this man it involved strapping the mans hand to this glove like thing with a eye curler near the front then the guy in white pushed on this lever and ripped his nail off i cant possibly describe how i felt the screams were starting to blend together i somehow managed to close my eyes the noise stopped and all i heard next was the womens voice saying and i quote I love you when i opened my eyes i was back in my room staring at the ceiling. i did not go back to sleep that night and stayed off school as well for that day. These dreams happen in an irregular fashion but this previous one was the worst am i going insane or is this normal the female sounds familial but i cant pin it. the dreams are still happening but im sort of accepting it if i don't squirm or make a noise i get this strange warmth on my shoulders almost like a hand so can i get anyones opinion on this.", "My dream started off with me sitting on the ground near the back of the plane. But there was no back TO the plane. Instead there was a deck with only a fence around the edges. It was getting close to night time and out behind the plane i could see two moons and many, many, stars. I badly wanted to get my telescope and look at them. But then suddenly the whole plane was engulfed into a cloud. Right after we started hitting turbelents and i was very scared. I could not see the people 5 feet in front of me in the cloud. I was closing my eyes and said out loud, Man! clouds, turbelents, scary music! (oddly in the background scary music was playing...) I hate this!!! I was extremely freaked out. But then when i opened my eyes i was on a normal seat in the plane and i was sitting next to my dad. They announced that we were going to begin descending. But we were decending waaay too fast. Suddenly we burst from the clouds above and mountains were visible very close to to the plane. And we were heading straight toward one! i was holding on to my seat very very hard. Then right as we were about to crash into the peak of the mountain we veered up and right. (i was watching it from like a 3rd person's point of view above the plane) but we turned too hard and did a flip in the air and i felt a weightless experience. We were now out of control and heading straight down toward the runway. I was beginning to think these were probably ganna be my last moments alive. But instead of crashing on the ground we appeared to bounce but i was still extremely frightened. Then after another about 10 seconds of horror we finally landed and i was completely relieved! but as i looked to my left i saw my dad leaning against the seat in front of him. I worriedly asked, Dad! are you okay??! and he replied, yes im fine. But this crazy flight was not over yet. Apparently a buffalo had strayed onto the runway but instead of trying to avoid it we were trying to hit it with the nose of the plane. We hit it several times but it was very large. They then dispatched some vehicals to take care of the buffalo. We were now connected to the airport. We proceded off the plane and as we exited we recieved a plack of everyone who was on the plane. Judging from the amount of pictures i saw i would say there was anywhere from 30-50 people aboard. We walked up to a front desk in the airport and exclaimed, Thank God we're Alive!!! my dad said i know I then started to wonder about when the rest of my family would arrive and if they were going to land safely. On the front desk there was a paper with picture of previous crashes that had occured. There was alot. My dad told me how we were now in India. Then somehow we were talking to a guy and he was telling us that he was a astronaut and he was showing us an album of all the picture he had. (about 5 nights later i had a dream on the moon) Somewhere around here the dream slowly ended.... Some things that tie in with the dream is that about 20 minutes before i fell asleep i was watching star wars and they were in there plane like things on a planet veering in and out of hills not hitting them--that explains the one part. and the other is that i play a game in real life called flight simulator and on one mode when you hit the ground you bounce. So that is my dream!!", "I was at the train station with my bestfriend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend and his ex girlfriend. We were sitting down on the bench waiting for the train. I was sitting in the middle of my boyfriend and my bestfriend, her boyfriend was on the other side and my boyfriends ex was on his other side. Him and his ex kept flirting infront of me and he totally ignored me. My bestfriend was giving me eye contact asking me why my boyfriend and his ex were both flirting, and i had no idea why. It was awkward for me, my bestfriend and her boyfriend. All three of us were both confused why my boyfriend and his ex were both flirting..I felt like an idiot. They would just touch eachother, and he even let her sit on his lap..It had went on for 10 minutes, then my bestfriend and her boyfriend disappeared. My boyfriend and his ex started kissing eachother on the cheek and giggling and being so flirty. It was like i didn't exist in his world anymore.. Then i started talking to him and flirting with him and he done the same back, his ex were giving me the evils and didn't talk. I kept flirting with my boyfriend and he paid attention to me. It changed to the centre near mines, and we were holding hands and flirting, and his ex was telling him that she was gonna go meet her bestfriend and she went off quiet and all upset, and she didn't come back..then my dream ended. Can anyone tell me what this means? Does it mean he flirts with his ex behind my back? Or is he cheating on me without me even knowing?", "Hello! I have been experiencing something strange regarding sleep. For years, I have been getting dreams right from the minute I sleep until when I get up, very rarely I do not get any dream I remember. The dreams will be like a lengthy movie which lasts for several hours, but not on the same topic always. Sometimes I dream of a movie where artists will come coupled with relatives/friends. Sometimes, they feel like something natural/practical, sometimes the dreams will not be related in any way. An even more strange thing is if I am awaken in the middle of a particular dream, I find that the same dream continues when I fall back asleep. Because of these dreams, I feel confused sometimes if a particular incident happened really or if it was in a dream! I do not feel like I have slept or relaxed, normally other people get up with swollen eyes, or a fresh face but I hardly get such situation. I feel the reason behind this may be because I had very poor sleep in my teenage years. I used to be in my grandma's home, she used to keep the door open all through night for air, I used to feel very afraid & used to forcibly keep myself awake as best as I could & would go to sleep when she gets up @ 5 in the morning. Even now I can sleep comfortably in the day time of course the dreams do come but I feel some relaxation. Now I am 27 yrs old & am under weight, my eyes will always have dark circles. I'll think a lot in sleep because of these dreams, so many why's & how's disturb me all through the sleep. I would be grateful if anyone can suggest a solution.", "Its scary. I keep having dreams where im getting abused, harrased, or about to be raped. It all started with this one dream where im walking to some destination that i have no clue of and on my way I come across about 3 or 4 guys that start staring me down.I soon notice that they are following me and i try to walk faster but not make it noticable that im trying to get away. They then attack me and hold me to the floor. They try taking off my clothes and im screaming and crying and calling for help but no one is near by. But before they take off all my clothes i always wake up! And ever since that dream i keep having dreams that are about the same topic. But then recently I have dreams where i have a boyfriend who is physically abusive. I try to break up with him but im too scared because he threatens to kill me or lock me in the house. And in this dream for some reason im living with this boyfriend of mine. And in the dream i always try to run away but the boy knows everyone and everyone knows him and he has homies all over the town who spot me trying to escape and they always call him and tell him where im at or they kidnap me and bring me back to him. ITS REALLY SCARYYY! When ever i have those dreams i always wake up sweaty or my heart is racing 100miles per hour.", "In my dream last night, I woke up on the floor in my parent's room. It was dimly lit. I wondered why I was there and tried to get up. I found that I couldn't move at all, though, try as I might. Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw a silhouette of my dad. I tried calling to him for help, but I couldn't speak either. The silhouette came closer, but it turned out to be just a massive shadow. I began freaking out, trying to move; trying to escape. I screamed internally as the shadow completely darkened my vision. Then... I woke up in my own bed. It's morning and the memory of the previous dream's fresh in my mind. I run upstairs to tell my sister about it. Thinking back, my house looked really different (elements of an Asian dojo mixed with my actual house), but whatever. I go into her room and start explaining when I see something move in the corner of the room. It's the shadow again, moving towards me on the ground. I shout at my sister to run downstairs and I follow close after her. An iron fence appeared at the bottom of the stairs, though, with other family members on the other side trying to open it. I turn around and try to fend off the shadow that's drawing closer. Seeing that it was hopeless, I turn to my sister to tell her to hurry up, but when I do, I see her disintegrating and her form turning into the shadow. The two shadows then closed in on me from both sides. Vision blackened again. Then... I woke up in my sister's bed. The room looked the way it was supposed to and I was relieved. I walk into the hall and look into the bathroom. My aunt's in there. Remembering that in the first two dreams, the first family member I meet attacked me, I avoid the bathroom and go to my parent's room. The door was open and I peer in. My mom's there, ironing. I tell her that I just had the weirdest dreams when she suddenly turned into the shadow and attacked me... Then.. I wake up in my family van and I know that I'm there waiting for my family who went shopping to come back. I see my grandpa walk close and he opened the door, setting the grocery bags into the car. I tense up, suddenly remembering the dreams. He came in and offered me things he bought from the Chinese bakery on the corner. I accepted, suspicious, but in my dream, fifteen minutes passed without anything suspicious happening and I relaxed. My parents and siblings found their way back and we went driving off. We just started driving when I see my other aunt on the sidewalk, scolding something. I see that it's her dog, Gigi. She was yelling at Gigi to come down from the building. Gigi was clinging to the side of the building, running away from my aunt by jumping to the side and clinging to the building. I didn't find this weird at all in my dream when I first saw it. However, after about 5 seconds, I realized that this wasn't normal and I turned back to look again I see that Gigi is staring at me intently. Gigi then turned black and into a shadow. The shadow sped towards me, closing the distance in just a second. I start screaming and my vision blacks out. Then... I wake up. Once again, I'm unable to move. This time, though, I am completely sure that I'm dreaming and command myself to move. I do and I stand up. Excited, since it was the first time I was ever completely conscious that I was dreaming, I run outside and will myself to fly. I rise a few inches and fall. This happened a few times. I finally rose above my house and the trees. I was disappointed, though, since flying didn't feel as amazing as I'd thought it would be. I was lazily flying around when I suddenly was unable to fly anymore. I was over a canyon that was randomly there and I fell for a long time into this dark pit. Then... I wake up. I decide to do the tests to see if I'm dreaming or not. I pinch myself and my skin stretched out like those kneaded erasers and falls into my lap. I groan and then decide to test what I heard the other day about how you can't turn on/off lights in your dreams. It was true - I couldn't. I decide to just sit there and wait. I was just sitting down when.. I actually woke up, dad screaming at me to hurry up since the people I carpool with to school were already waiting for me for a while. This all happened within 2 hours. I slept at 4am and woke up at 6:10am. It was the strangest dream I ever had ._.", "Ever since the new teen sensation Justin Bieber came to be, I obtained almost an obsession with him. Not a little girl obsession where I'd do anything to marry him, but an obsession with his music, personality, and what he's done to help others, ect. At least every other night I have very very vivid dreams about Justin Bieber. These dreams range from my mom bring him to my workplace to surprise me, being on a date with him, and simply just hanging out like best friends. The feelings that I encounter during these dreams are tremendous. They overrule all emotions I've ever felt before, I wake up in a daze hoping it was all real. I know I'm a lucid dreamer because of previous dreams, but for some reason, whenever Justin Bieber is in my dreams, the dreams seem so unbelievably real that I do not recognize I am actually dreaming (even though when I wake up I realize how unrealistic my dreams are). Even though being able to control your dreams is a power most wish to have, I am kind of ecstatic that these dreams aren't controlled.", "It all started in a Spanish town. It was hot, i was with my friend Maelai and we we're eating ice cream. Suddenly everyone started screaming A LION HAS ESCAPED!! So me and Maelai started to flee the town untill my other friend Brandon ran around the corner screeching LIONNN, RUN! So we did i ended up in a house with a girl called Keelan andit was her bestfriend's boyfriend's room. She lay on the floor and coverd herself with a towel texting someone on her phone. I got up and ran outside into the street to see the Lion sitting on top of aq house and it jumped down ripping people apart right infrount of my eyes.It swooped down and clawed my sholder and my grandad tryed to protect me and the lion killed him. I fled and i appeard at school in my art classrooom, Mr Donally was sitting at the desk. A 16 or 17 year old boy stormmed into the room and said I'm the lion, now you will all die.. We all looked at him. No your not, your human He turned into the lion then back to human. The man smirked as my classmates tryed to hide their fear. The Lion boy is what i will call him i thought. He walked toward my teacher and killed him right there. He then started taking my friends out singally to kill them, He'd killed two so far. He got Sam outside, he plays guitar. He told Sam to play his guitar while he was killed so we could all hear how fast this was. So he did, and it was horrid. The Lion boy came back into the room looking for his next victim, and told him Kill me last, I'll fight for my life The Lion boy gave me a grim look and looked around for who he was to kill next. I grabbed his arm and he pushed me violently off. I said to him You don't have to do this, stop it! Just be yourself we both know this isin't who you want to be. Just stop this wreckles killing and get on with your life noone will know your the Lion He looked at me, as if to say he knew it already. For some reason we we're forced to get on with our normal school day and he went on killing people around the school but he'd left my class and me alone. A guy in 4th year walked up to me in the hall and shouted Your going to get us all killed you idiot! and punched me i fell across the hall and smacked my head off the floor. The lion boy seen, grabbed the boy that had done this to me and ripped him apart. I was shocked i didn't say anything and walked away. I was about to walk into my next class when Mr Zusko walked buy holding loads of grenades. He was going to try and kill the Lion boy i knew it. I ran after him Mr Zusko! Please no! You don't understand he isin't like that! Mr Zusko was the Science technition and didn't talk much. He walked on buy me, planting bombs everywhere. I saw the Lion boy run from behind me up to try and kill Mr Zusko i ran trying to avoid being killed myself.. a bomb went off blinding me with smoke, but o body to be seen. He was still alive. I ran around trying to find Mr Zusko before it was to late and he'd killed the Lion boy. Callum Rigg was walking along the same corrdior i stopped CALLUM WHERE IS THE LION BOY I NEED TO KNOW NOW! PLEASE. Callum replied Hes dead.. he was blown up.. i screamed and ran around everywhere crying looking for him. We'd never actually properly talked but i wonderd why the Lion boy gave me any mercey and spared my life, even protected me when i was in trouble. It wen't black. I appeard in a dark, wet street it had just been raining the only thing lighting up the street was distant houses and the orange street lights. I was with Maelai again. I seen a boy and a girl holding hands and another boy and girl walking together. From under the street lights i seen a familiar face. It was him! The Lion boy, he'd taken my advice, hes safe! Hes alive! I ran to wards him and he greeted me with open arms. We hugged for a while i looked up at his face to see he was smiling My dream ended, right there Does this mean anything..?", "I was in the Centre with a really hot guy friend that i had no idea who it was..we were walking and talking. Behind us was a couple, and the guy was very hot..i got jealous and told my friend to hold my hand. me: hold my hand! boy: why? me: oh just do it! *hold hands* We then walked into 'Claires accessories' and the layout was very strange and very different.. There were pens, notebooks and build your own toys..which were made from paper. Oh, and the couple had followed us into the shop aswell. I kept seeing the hot guy looking at me and i would just look away. I then walked up to the notebook section and looked at the notebokes. Then came a girl that looked like 9-11 with long,frizzy,curly hair..wearing blue eyeshadow and slutty clothes..and she started to talk to me. girl: have you ever had sex before? me: what?.. girl: have you ever had sex before? me: *thinks in mind: no..* yes.. girl: oh, i've had sex 17 times, who did you have sex with? m er, my boyfriend... girl: your a gimp. me: how? girl: cause you had sex with your boyfriend..you just don't do that. i have sex with everyone me: erm, okay. *DREAM CHANGES For some reaosn i was in my grans house and there was a zombie apocalypse. Me and my dad were the only survivers. We were in my grans house finding some jackets and food. I was wearing a black dress..i found one jacket but my dad told me not to wear the jacket because it didn't suit the dress and that i would freeze to death if i did, but the jacket was very fluffy. I then found the perfect jacket which belongs to my grans..she normanlly wears it when she comes over to my house or when we go out for something to eat. I wore the jacket and went out. I was waiting for my dad..and he had finally came out of the house and quietly locked the door. He had ran and went away without me and climbed over fences and he disappeared. I panicked and started climbing over fences to catch up with him. But i couldn't find him..and my dream ended.", "The dream starts off with me recognizing that I'm no longer trying to go to sleep in my bed because I'm now standing with a shot gun in the middle of an almost never ending field of knee high grass. My shoes aren't on, which is a funny feeling since I can feel the grass shift in between my toes, so I realize that I must be dreaming because I have a shotgun but no shoes. Weird logic, but that's how it went, so I guess that makes it a low level lucid dream. Anyways, I decide I might as well get this dream over with, so I start walking through the grass towards a hill in the distance. Once I reach the top of the hill, I see to the other side that there's not only more grass, but a crowd of randomly dressed people huddled in front of the door of a building with gorgeous looking windows. When I get closer, they notice me and my gun, and approach me, asking me to use it to help them get rid of the danger in their library. They lead me over to the windows to let me see what I'd be dealing with, and I see a bunch of undead corpses standing facing different bookshelves. Just standing stock still, staring at the shelves, making tiny movements with their heads that you can see from their twitching neck tendons (I didn't actually see their heads move, but their necks did the motions). A lady from the crowd pulls out a chicken with a rope around it's legs from nowhere. She then slits its neck, opens the door and flings in the chicken, and one of the zombies perks up and starts chasing after it, and she pulls the rope so it would chase it outside. When the zombie is out of the library, with me having my left shoulder facing the windows, it shields its eyes from the sun and turns over to me. I raise my gun ready to shoot, and it opens its mouth and starts singing the word Wait! in an opera-esque voice. I falter, end up misfiring, and shoot the building by accident. It continues to sing in a deep, reverberating voice of why they won't eat us, and other zombies start to file out and sing too, not like a chorus to the main one, but mixing in and out for the focus singer. The first zombie never looks at anybody else, seemingly singing to me and me alone, which makes my skin crawl, and as his jaw gets closer and closer to falling off with each note (while he gets closer and closer to me, making me stumble and fall on my butt), the other zombies mix in with the crowd. Still singing, they make graceful motions towards the crowd of survivors, and each one picks up one onto its shoulder and raises its free hand from its hip to level with its shoulder in a waving motion before disappearing and leaving me by myself in that field with a library. After hearing such a beautiful song (Which I wish I knew more about opera to be able to place a good example of what it could sound like), I try to think of a reason to stay alive in this dream, because if I stay alive, something else will take up the memory of that song. The more I contemplated it, the less of the song I could remember, so I freaked out and decided right there to end the dream with my usual method by killing myself. Thank god I had that gun, or else I probably wouldn't have been able to leave till something else got me.", "I had a dream where I was walking around on a cloudy day, and just as I thought it was going to start to rain, giant oranges started falling from the sky. I fled the area and tried to get into my house, but it was blocked by a huge pile of giant oranges. Then all of a sudden, every person outside turned into a giant orange. It was terrifying.", "I had found myself waking from a nap and as soon as I opened my eyes, I noticed that I was floating down a river. I was still on top of my bed, which had suddenly turned into a boat. As I was floating down the river, the surroundings began to drastically change. I was floating through a jungle and could hardly see to either side of me because of the trees and shrubs. Soon I passed the trees and could finally see light, but I couldn’t see ahead of me because of the huge waterfall right in front of me. I remember being extremely terrified, but as soon as I passed the edge it was as though my bed was floating on the air. When I arrived at the bottom of the waterfall, I saw two blurry figures standing on the riverbanks. As I got closer, I saw the two figures were none other than George Washington and Albert Einstein. The three of us then began to have a deep, philosophical conversation. For some reason, George Washington was deeply upset with Einstein. Then, all of a sudden, there was a huge gust of wind that moved my bed down the stream and away from Washington and Einstein. After that, I woke up.", "I had a dream in which the benefits of both Hong Kong and Palo Alto were made available to me in one blended reality. As I got hungry while I worked in my Palo Alto room, I just had to walk outside to the kitchen and ask my maid in Hong Kong to make me a bowl of wonton noodles. The living room was pleasantly cool as I waited for food because of the blasting air-con but I suddenly realized that I was running late for a meeting. I hurriedlyy put on my shoes and rushed out of the apartment. The elevator ride was very fast because it was my Hong Kong elevator but when I got outdoors, I was not greeted with the oppressive humidity that comes with tropical summers. Instead, I patiently waited for a red taxi in the fresh and dry Palo Alto air. When an empty taxi stopped, I quickly hopped on and recited my destination in Cantonese. I remember how much I enjoyed the nice green vegetation that I passed during the ride before I woke up.", "I had this dream when I was a kid. The dream started with my whole family (excluding my dad) walking out of sears looking for our car. After probably a half hour of looking we saw It on the top of a parking garage and we dragged our cart full of stuff up the stairs. then as we were loading the stuff into the car we heard a roar kinda so we jumped in the car and just appeared on the road. Somehow I knew we were getting chased by a monster and tried to get home I don't remember how but I got separated from my family and ended up in a different car driving. So I was still trying to get home and away from the monster but it was catching up to me so I pulled into another car garage and hid. I didnt see the monster but I saw it's shadow and it was huge. Then all of a sudden it knocked down the wall and I forgot what happened next. But I remember running up to a some house that I supposedly lived at and went in. I said hello to see if anyone was home and then I woke up so I never knew if my family made it home alive.", "This is, hands down, one of the creepiest dreams I have ever experienced. It is very short but nonetheless scary. The real question that still remains to this day is, was it really a dream? In my dream I was walking down a dark, deserted alleyway. It was obviously nighttime, and a dangerous place to be walking by myself. I didn't know why I was there or how I got there, but I just kept walking. I eventually hit a dead end, and turned around to face a mob of hooded figures. I called out to them asking them who they were and why they had followed me, but they did not answer. I could not see their faces, but could only hear their labored breaths escaping from the darkness inside their coats. I was not afraid, strangely, for it seems to make sense that I would find this situation scary in real life. I turned around once more to where the dead end was, but the wall had transformed into another small passageway that was too dark to see through. The figures behind me crept closer, and even though I had no other way to go, for some reason I knew that I should not go. As I turned to face the mysterious passageway once more, I felt a searing pain in my left wrist and as I looked down I saw a disfigured hand clench around my wrist, dragging me into the passageway. At this point I woke up startled in the middle of the night, but went back to sleep shortly afterward. When I woke up in the morning having forgotten that I had a terrifying nightmare, I felt pain in my left wrist. I looked down and saw slight bruises covering my wrist and at that moment, remembered my dream from earlier in the night. The bruises seemed to match a pattern of fingers enclosed around my wrist, which really creeped me out. Since that morning, I can only think that it was myself who grabbed my left wrist with my right hand, reacting to the figure grabbing my wrist in the dream. What I still dont understand, though, is how I could have inflicted this pain on myself, enough to cause a bruise. Of course it was no one else around me physically that night, so who could it have been?", "This dream is definitely one of those dreams that reflect inner desires. I've been in a long term relationship, and this dream demonstrates what things I've had in mind. I'm on a date. It's actually a very sweet date. We are walking on the beach and the air is warm on my skin and we are holding hands. You're telling me and joke. It's hilarious I am really happy. I look up, and you're not my boyfriend. In fact, you're this really cute guy who I see around all the time. I feel a jolt of excitement when I realize that this is so, SO bad of me. I start crying and I turn around. I see him there. I feel terrible. I run after him, and he speeds away like freaking Flash. Of course, as all dreams go, I am running as if I am under water. He disappears before I can reach him and tears are streaming down my face. I fall on my knees and cry as hard as I can because I made a terrible mistake. I wake up suddenly, and the pit in my stomach grows lighter. It was just a dream, yes. However, it is only a matter of time before that dream becomes a reality. I really need to end things or cut off these desires for good or else someone is going to get hurt.", "During a nap, I dreamed that I was walking around downtown Palo Alto. It was dusk, and I started hearing footsteps behind me. I tried to ignore them for a while, but after a few minutes I decided to turn around and see if anybody was there. It turns out that I was being followed by a giant turtle with huge green eyes. For some reason I asked the turtle what he was doing and whether I knew him. He didn't answer because he was a turtle. I decided that he probably wasn't dangerous and kept walking with him following behind. I got a lot of compliments on my pet turtle because he was so adorable. Just as I was trying to decide what to name him, I woke up.", "I had a dream the other night where I saw a rainbow in the sky, and decided to find the beginning of it and hop over to the other side. I searched and searched and searched and finally found the beginning of it, and saw the pot of gold on the other side. But as I was trying to cross, multiple leprechauns tried stopping me by telling me that the pot of gold was only for special people. After crying and begging, they finally let me see the pot of gold, but when I touched it I realized it was fake. I woke up very disappointed.", "I woke up this morning from a dream that my group's teaching presentation at Menlo Atherton went terribly wrong. Pretty much the worst case scenario. To begin, we had missed out transportation early in the day and had to fly to the school on Razor scooters. I didn't seem to recognize the absurdity of scooters in the sky during my dream but we finally arrived at the school on time and President Hennessy escorted us to our classroom. When we arrived at the room, we peered in to see 30 5 year-olds sitting in their desks waiting for our presentation. I was really relieved to see 5 year-olds because they were far less intimidating than the high school students I was expecting. Then they opened their mouths to speak and they sounded like a bunch of 30-year old academics. We started our presentation and I pulled out my poster, only to see that it was on Reality Television, rather than Sleep and Dreams. I started to teach these intelligent 5 year-olds about reality T.V., we watched an episode of Jersey Shore, and then we analyzed the social roles played by each character. After that, Ronnie and JWow from The Jersey Shore made a guest appearance during our presentation. When they walked in, all of the 5 year-olds seemed to already know them. They started talking in Jersey accents and their skin turned orange. All of a sudden, they started a party in the classroom and my group and I immediately ran out (terrified, I guess). We couldn't take the scooters back since they were stuck up in a tree so we hopped on the CalTrain which took us right to our door in Suites.", "After returning back to the Farm after an extended hiatus I have had many thoughts about taking S&D. Now, here enters Sandman..I was surrounded by water and it was rising fast. How to get out?, I thought. I was trapped inside a big cruise ship and the corridors were so small and water was at my knees already. Oh no- I thought of sinking like the Titanic but I must find a way to somehow survive and keep my head above the water. I raced back and forth, up and down through the ship. People were jumping overboard. It was dark and stormy, however, the water was tropically warm. The water kept rising. There was no way out. A huge tidal wave was looming over the cruise ship and about to crash on me..I found a way out..I started to surf this monster wave. It was fantastic- the clouds began to break and sunny skies lay ahead..I woke up to the sound of gentle waves and warm sunshine upon my face. A sensational feeling- relieved and lucky to be alive...Any thoughts or posts to shed light on meaning of this particular lucid yet scary dream?", "After spending early saturday morning watching the remastered version of The Exorcist, I decided to head to bed before the clock hit 3:00 am (just to avoid any unwanted scares) As I entered my dream, I was stuck in a room with a small dog, larger than a chihuahua but still probably weighing 9-10 pounds, guarding the door. This was no ordinary dog. It had the freakish eyes and mangled face of Linda Blair's character in the movie. I edged closer and when I got to within 5 feet of the door, the dog started talking to me with that deep, raspy, devilish voice. I was stunned and unaware what to do. There were no windows, no other way out other than the door. I began talking to the dog/devil, trying to convince it to just let me go but it was to no avail. Then out of nowhere, I found myself at a dinner table with a group of people I found familiar but could not name them other than one person from my dorm and my parents. Beside me was this elderly woman who quietly sat there. The meal went on and we were served bowtie pasta with pesto sauce and a chicken breast I believe. I wanted to be polite and strike a conversation with the woman next to me but as soon as i said excuse me, she turned her head a complete 90 degrees without moving her body closer to me and her face resembled Linda Blair's face in the movie. I was so startled that I feel off my chair, which served as a kick to wake me up.", "Hurry up man. That was the first voice I heard as my eyes opened from what I am guessing was a small nap. The snow was lightly descending from the overcast heavens and I slowly gained the strength to rise from my fetal positioned nap. As I stood up I looked over the ledge off to my left and lurched back in astonishment. My team once again demanded I hurry up and I ashamedly asked,What altitude are we at? As they started up the mountain they hollered back,1 camp away from the summit big guy. Not that that answer really answered my question, but at least it implied that we were actually making our way up to the summit of whatever peak this was I hurriedly joined my team on their way up the icy face of the mountain and was seemingly perplexed by why our team leader felt it was necessary to carry a boombox up the face of the mountain blasting winter wonderland played by Miles Davis. It was actually slightly eery. Why the same song over and over again? Couldnt he pick a pandora station or something to mix it up? Anyway, after several close calls traversing crevices and icy faces, I heard the call ahead from the leader yelling,we have made it! People ran around in an exhilarated fashion and I continued to be just a tad bit confused as to where we were. The summit was nothing but a parking lot and a 7-11. I looked back on what we had just climbed to make sure this slurpee haven was actually at the summit of this mountain an sure enough it was. When I peered over the edge, it looked like a snowy version of the warp hole Luke skywalker fell down in Star Wars. Not really knowing what else to do I proceeded to enter the 7-11, order a mountain dew slurpee, and lottery ticket. As my team summoned me once again saying that it was time to leave I payed for my things and joined them at the top for a quick team picture at the summit. It was a Kodak moment. Before we started on our way down I told everyone I needed to scratch my lottery ticket first. I needed to match three of the same number to win. First number: $200,00 second number: $200,000 Boom Alarm clock sounds. Me: Damn, 7 AM lift.", "Today I had a dreadful dream. The dream started with me lying in a hospital bed in a large quarantine facility. There were many beds in this place with people occupying them.The people were in agony with IV tubes attached to them. The room must have had about 60 beds each having a person (including myself) suffering from a dreadful and lethal type of influenza. The symptoms were clear and eerily vivid. The weakness, fever, coughing, body pain, vomiting were overwhelming. I then remember walking into a huge bathroom facility with toilets everywhere. No privacy was available. All the toilets were stainless steel. I had the strongest urge to rid myself of diarrhea. I noticed people of all ages, even good-looking women ridding themselves of diarrhea. It was shameful and people were embarrassed, but we had no choice but to use the bathroom and deal with it. I heard people using the bathroom and the loud sound of loose defecation and the moaning of people. It was awful. I noticed myself in my bed surrounded by the others and I was looking out the window into a parking lot. I then noticed a large group of women dressed in uniforms coming into the quarantine facility. I asked one of them if they were here because they were sick, but one lady replied “no, I am here to offer you your last rights.” She then asked me how long do I have left to live. I replied “Only a few days.” At that moment I rallied the crowd to beg the doctors to administer codeine. At that time a wide array of nurses worked to administer pain medication and sedatives to ease our discomfort. Thats all I can remember.", "I was laying on my stomach on the floor of my nana's beside my dad and we were both aged 10. We were playing with his old transformers (he had tons as a kid). My great grandpa who died well before I was born was sitting on the coffee table in front of us looking very sad and seemed as if he was curious about something. I've only ever heard stories about him and my dad was very close to him and never willingly talked about him. Neither has my nana. What does this mean?", "I had a dream in which night was day and day was night. As in, the day went backward, so when me and all my friends woke up in the morning, there was darkness all around us. Going through the day in backward stages was quite strange. We all had to go to classes at night, and when we fell asleep in class, the teachers would yell because supposedly in my dream, night occurring during the day time was normal. No one expected you to want to sleep during class during the wee hours of the night. Interestingly the meals were all the same, so we ate cereal and toast when it looked like it was 9 PM outside. Then when we saw a crack of sunlight coming in over the horizon, it was time to go to bed. Going to bed with the light out was so difficult for me, and I could not bear living in a world like this. Thankfully I woke up and everything was normal around me, I looked out my window and saw the sun shining.", "As the title indicates, my dream was basically a mix between the movies JFK, and Men in Black. I'm guessing it was influenced by my watching of JFK that night, but I don't know where the Men in Black part of it came from. Basically, the President was killed, and there was a group of aliens that were the major suspects. I don't remember what all the aliens looked like, but I recall one having three heads that could be split apart, or put together to be made to look like a true human head. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were given the task of solving the mystery of which aliens killed the President. This is about all I remember of the dream, but it was still a very odd experience for me.", "A fairly short dream, but strange nonetheless. I own an alarm clock shaped like the head of Darth Vader, as I am an avid Star Wars fan. In my dream, my friend from high school appeared in my dorm holding my Darth Vader clock in one hand and began saying Alas, poor Yoric! I knew him, Horatio... etc, reciting Hamlet's monologue. Then I woke up. I found it somewhat strange that I apparently have Shakespeare subconsciously memorized.", "My Grandparents randomly came to visit me in my dorm. I was confused yet excited. I asked them why they decided to visit me. They responded that they wanted to see me because it had been a while and that they needed to show me something. My grandfather brought a golden monkey that had a ring on it's third finger. The ring had a red ruby which startled me. Confused, I asked them what it was. My grandfather told me that it was our family treasure and that it was now my turn to look after it. My roommate was in the room at the time and heard the entire story. At the time, I didn't realize this would be a problem. My grandparents asked me to go home and my roommate asked me if he could come too. I gladly agreed. One night, my roommate faked that he was asleep and attempted to steal the ring. I caught him red handed. Then, out of nowhere, he summoned these odd creatures that stifled my movement. He laughed and said something about becoming extremely rich. He then vanished and so did his odd minions. The next day I expressed my grief to my friend, unsure of the consequences. I then awoke by the sound of my alarm, relieved to see that my roommate was still sleeping.", "I was back in the seventh grade and our class was preparing to go on a field trip to the local flee market. We packed our bags and lunches and boarded the bus. We got stuck in a lot of traffic and there were issues with our tickets to get into the flee market, so we sat in front of the entrance and ate our lunches, not allowing anyone else into the building. Once we were finally squared away, we entered the building. The vendors seemed to be saying something in a different language and I soon realized our class had entered an Indian flee market. There was magic lamps and sparkly coins everywhere. We continued walking because time was wasting. We stepped over a stone and through a door to the next department and little did we know we had entered Japan. There was sushi and Geishas everywhere. Samurais paraded their fancy swords in the dusty streets. Amazed, we did not even know when we walked right out of Japan and into Africa. My favorite object in this flee market was a little elephant carved from sacred wood that fit perfectly in my hands. It's tusks were so sharp and fine, I pricked my finger on it and woke up.", "Right before noon, I felt a bit tired reading for midterms and decided to take a quick one hour nap before class started. After setting my books down and setting my alarm clock, I crept under the covers and tried to get some sleep. I was already feeling pretty dazed when I was in bed and could consciously feel myself slowly transitioning into a sleepier and sleepier state. Soon, I heard a rushing/windy noise around my ears (very similar to the Noise made in the TV show LOST whenever character flashbacks occur). The rushing noise got louder and abruptly stopped. I could no longer move any of my muscles. I was still completely conscious and could see my surroundings, but no matter how hard I tried, my muscles were set in stone, and I could only feel the lungs in my chest slowly expanding/deflating. I've had these kinds of cases of sleep paralysis before, and I knew I just had to remain calm and eventually either I'd black out into sleep or regain control over my muscles. I eventually regained control of my muscles but still felt sleepy. The rushing noise once again rang in my ears and in a few seconds my body was rigid again. This time, however, I could feel my consciousness slowly fading away too. While things got more and more fuzzy, I kept repeating to myself Lucid Dreams, Lucid Dreams, Nothing's real. I found myself in a padded yellow cell dimly lit. I was so sure that this was not real, I decided to see if I truly had control over my dreams. I wanted the walls to turn black, and immediately they did. The next thing I knew, I was in total darkness, dimly aware that I was still in a sleeping pose, but still in a dreamlike state. I tried to summon up things in existence like Strawberries or Roller Coasters, but I only felt sensations (like taste or thrill). It still remained dark. The next thing I knew, I was back in my bed eyes open, my blanket covering me up to my shoulders. My eyes were fixed on the Stanford Banner hanging from my wall. When I tried to move -- nothing happened. My eyes remained fixed, my neck was rigid, and my arms and legs felt huge resistance whenever I wanted to move. I tried moving my arms again. This time I saw the blanket move and I managed to get my arms over my blanket. Immediately, the whole situation reset, with me lying in my bed, eyes fixed on the Stanford Banner, blankets covering me up to my shoulders. Again I tried moving my arms and legs, this time I saw both of them move and I got to a curled up position. Immediately, the whole situation reset and I was back in my bed, in sleeping position under the blankets, staring at the Stanford Banner. Again I tried moving, this time bringing myself to an upright position; the situation reset itself again. Each time I tried to move, I got a little bit farther, off the bed, near the door, outside the door in the hallway (I saw a janitor), but every single time I went a little farther, the next thing I knew, everything reset itself and I was back in my bed, immobilized, staring at the Stanford Banner. I knew this wasn't reality -- I couldn't really feel my arms moving or truly feel the carpet or notice details about my surroundings. But no matter what I did I ended back in the same situation, in an endless infinite loop. I wasn't sure if I was ever going to escape the situation. I had no control. I could just tell myself to calm down and keep my heart rate low (my lungs and my heart, ironically I could feel very vividly). This loop continued for a long time, but I can only remember 15 distinct cycles. The next thing I knew, I was really awake (I don't know how to prove that), but I could feel the air rushing through my mouth and feel the texture of the bedsheets on my arms. Tentatively, I jumped off my bed and felt the carpet under my feet. I was so relieved, I ran down and immediately had lunch. As I drank my fruit punch, I thought to myself; it was never so great to be back in reality.", "Last night i had a dream that i was in the elavotor in the ballymun blocks were my auntie arlene used to live. she lived on the 5th floor which was inconvenient for because before she lived in that flat her previous one went on fire which left her no choice but to jump out the window. because of this she had to always used the lift and not the stairs because her legs wernt able to climb so many stairs. in my dream she says that she is not gettin in the lift and that she wud rather walk the stairs which was weird but i went ahead and got in it anyway. as soon as i got in the lift i had deja vu and im not sure it was because id had the same dream before or if it was because i used to always use the lift when she lived there.. anyway as soon as i got in the ligts start to flicker and i was picked up by my jumper and throwin against the four walls of the elevator and it was when this happened that i remembered a girl had died in the lift before. i was so scared i started talkin to the ghost, she was a child but she was nasty and in the dream i think i recognised her but im not so sure now. it isn't the first time iv had this dream and i wonder what it means ??", "So, a few nights ago I was asleep when suddenly there was an elephant in the room with me. It was weird because we were just in our dorm room (my friend and I), and there was this large, pinkish-purplish elephant... but the elephant fit perfectly! My friend even said, How about we use this elephant as a table? And so we did use the elephant as a table, for a little while. I think maybe we had a tea party, or something. I remember though as we were trying to have our tea party my cell phone kept ringing, and I kept saying to the elephant, I need to go find my phone! But the elephant would always stick out its trunk (which for some reason was blue, even though the rest of it was pink) and not let me go get my phone. It was quite traumatic. Anyways, I don't know quite how the tea party ended, but then suddenly my friend was gone and it was just me and the elephant (who wasn't a table, any more) and we were walking on this circular path going higher and higher and then there were some birds that were coordinated with the elephant's colors, and they were all talking in this language that I didn't understand and really all I wanted was to find my phone (which the elephant had never let me find) and then suddenly my alarm went off and I woke up.", "I was moving into a new apartment at Stanford - this part isn't that weird because I am getting kicked out during Spring quarter for renovations. However, parts of the dream get weirder as it progresses. The neighborhood on campus I was moving to was called The Elephant King because there was a big jewel-studded elephant statue in the middle courtyard. I got out of my Car (still the same car in the dream - Asian Girl Corolla), unloaded some of my stuff, and then walked it to the new place. My new room was huge and a lot nicer than what I have now. There was a furnace that burned wood (old style) in the living room, too. My new roommates were out, so I decided to get more stuff with my car. I went back to the parking lot, but couldn't find my car. So I pulled out my remote and walked through aisles, clicking the unlocker. At least one car in every aisle beeped, but it wasn't my car. I got curious, so I tested one car (Nissan Versa) and was even able to drive it. With my Toyota keys. I gave up, and headed back to the new apartment. Along the way, I passed one of my old professors who looked like he was carrying an Ikea floorlamp. When I got to the apartment, one of my roommates was there. He looked like a hipster, but in his 30s. Short and stocky, but not fat. We introduced ourselves, and his name was Scott Palmerton. That's when I woke up.", "There was one particularly harrowing nightmare that haunted me through my senior year of high school, resulting in many interrupted nights of sleep. I would wake up from a dream into what I thought was the comfort of my 'real' bed. Before I had the chance to perceive this as a secondary dream, I was gripped by paralyzing fear as a monstrous wolf like creature came into my room and jumped on my bed. As it bent to bite my neck, I would wake up, always feeling unable to breathe for a few seconds.", "I was walking through a thick cloud of smoke. I look around me to find Native Americans smoking from their pipes. I breathe the smoke into my lungs. As I walk I come to a fire. It felt like a celebration or ceremony was about to take place. There stood a great man with a long head dress of beautiful feathers. He handed me a small ax, and showed me a pig lying on the ground. I could not understand him but I knew what he wanted me to do. I couldn't do it. I didn't want to kill this pig. I threw the ax across the fire and it transformed into a sword and stuck in the ground. I was ashamed. I walked over to the sword and grabbed the blade. The chief walk over a took my arm and lead me to a teepee of all different colors. I heard a man inside singing. The chief left me there. I was scared to go in. As I made my way in he stopped singing and looked at me, and then the blood dripping from my hand. Others that were there began leaving. He showed me the seat next to him as if telling me to sit down. He poured earth in my wound and then handed me a small brown leather bag. Inside was a necklace with a red rock. I left him and the others were waiting outside. I went off by myself and stared at the necklace. After awhile I put it on and made my way back out to the fire. The chef saw me and my new necklace. I had a sense that this should not be mine. The chief spoke and everyone listened. They got up and started to dance, moving the earth. I couldn't help it, but start to dance. I danced as hard as I could not caring of anything else. It was getting late and they stared to leave one by one. I kept dancing, and dancing until I fell to the ground in exhaustion. As I woke up it was still dark. The fire was still strong. I gaze across the fire to see the shaman sitting there staring at me. He gets up with grace and stands with his back to me. He turns around as if asking me to follow him and walked away. I followed him quickly. The sun was starting to come up by the time we reach the river. Then he spoke to me... He could speak ENGLISH! He told me that water is life. He explained that water had no great beauty or didn't smell like a flower. but yet the flowers and all the wonders of life depend on its presence. He jumped into the water and looked like a colorful fish swimming in the light. I jumped in after him. As we came up for air I was laughing. The water felt good. He took some in his hands for me to drink. I was the best water I have ever tasted. We left the river and began walking through the grassy meadows. He stopped to pick up some dirt and laid it in my hands. I let it run through my fingers. I buried my feet in the dirt and lay down in it. Burying my hands to. I realized there is value in all things. I was lying there my hands and feet in the cool dirt. The shaman walked over and shut my eyes and I woke up...", "Hi. Recently I had a lucid dream, in the dream i was in the middle of a frozen lake ice fishing with my father. Then suddenly in the dream I felt a sensation that was very queer. Both my hands suddenly got hit with something then i flashed out of the dream into complete darkness. I couldn't see a thing. I tried to open my eyes and get out of bed. It was no use i couldn't move a thing. Then I tried uttering a scream but nothing came out. Then as quickly as it came it went. I sprung out of my bed terrified. I didn't know what just happened to me. So I did a little research and found it was post sleep paralysis. I told two of my most trusted friends but they didn't believe me. Which only leaves me wondering, Did this really happen to me?", "I have very vivid dreams, this one I had a about a year back. I'd be interested in any input of why my dreams are so messed, or anything. Enjoy the story :) I was running down a street, knowing that something, or someone was chasing me, but I was too busy looking for an escape to look back. I turned down an old, yellowish brick alley, and just in time a cook came out of a back door that is normally locked form the outside. I got in just in time and the heavy metal door slammed behind. It was pitch black but I could tell that I was in a straight, narrow stair case going up. I could hear the thing clawing at the door behind me as I ran up the stairs with both hands on the wall for support. About half way up the stairs (They were very long stairs) I herd the door break down and the sound of the thing chasing me up the stairs. I popped out of the staircase through a little door in to, what appeared to be the second or third level of a very fancy hotel. It had red carpets and gold trim on the white walls. To my left was a huge staircase with the same red carpet and white marble hand rails. I ran down the stairs as fast as I could, swinging from the hand rails as I jumped many steps at a time. Finally I lost the thing. I was in the hotels restaurant. The restaurant was very much like the rain forest cafe if any one has been there. Sections of the restaurant each set up differently. Rain in one, ocean in an other, etc. Well my boyfriend was there, along with my brother and mother. It was a buffet and so we all got food, but then we all went to sit at different places. As my boyfriend and I sat down in a booth (There was a knight in bronze armor on the wall near us), I watched both my mom and brother die. One was from a shark attack while the other was from a lighting strike. (I can't remember which was which) It was at this point that I realized that the whoel restaurant was after me, I yelled at my bf and jumped on the table just in time. Dozens of poisonous snakes came out of the knights helmet on to the floor. We ran jumping from table to table, and chairs to chairs trying not to touch the floor as the horrible snakes came after us. We got to the entrance of restaurant and there, infront of us was a giant pink bunny. Like the social bunnies from the sims 2. It must have been what was chasing me before hand. Slowly it hopped toward us. We skid to a halt turned around and ran back. The snakes had dissapeared. We ran down a small white hallway in the back and got to a shiny silver elevator. I could hear the bunny coming down the hallway as I frantically pushed the button over and over again. I could see its shadow. The door of the elevator opened and my bf pulled me inside. I could see the bunny's pink face as the elevator door closed shut. We rid up the elevator, and now instead of being in a hotel, we are in a super fancy mall. Several stories high with a glass ceiling at the top. Above this glass ceiling is a roof top garden, which you could stand on and look all the way down past your feet through all the levels of the mall. Below the mall were two levels of parkade. It was night time and no one was in the mall, and the stars were out so when you looked up from anywhere you could see stars. Now the issue was that whenever we got out of the elevator to run, their the pink bunny would be hopping toward the elevator, perfeclty calm like. The dream went on for a while, getting out at each level and the bunny being there, us running back to the elevator and trying a new floor. Finally we attempt the parkade ground level for the 3rd time, it looks clear and we can see a car waiting for us at the entrance (or exit) to the parkade. We run, but there comes the bunny. My bf pushed me back standing in front of me and pulled out his sword attempting to fight off the evil bunny. The bunny got a hold of me, and then all went black. I died. Or so I thought. A few seconds later I woke up in a car with my bf driving frantically to his friends place where he was staying. We were going there to get his stuff and then get out of town. Now this house was in a corner of a crescent. With a large child's play ground. Somewhere along the way a child was also there. My bf went in to the house to grab his stuff while the child and I played on the playground. I noticed that there was a black van driving bakc and forth around the crescent. The child and I stopped and hid behind the playground watching this van. Then the van did a wierd transformy thing like a transformers truck. I realized the evil bunny was inside it. I ran inside to grab my bf yelling that we were found and under attack. Then the house blew up and it was all black. I slept for a while after that, then woke up later Anways, pretty normal dream for me, but I would love to hear others theory behind that dream. No I was not overly stressed at the time, I was at the end of grade 11. As far as I could tell at the time nothing special was going on in my life.", "Out of all dreams that I can remember this one really shook me. The first thing I remember is that I am on a small ship in the middle of a violent storm at sea. There is water everywhere as giant waves smash the ship around. Suddenlly I am swept over the ship and thrown into the ocean. I know that I have died because looking down on my family I can see them crying over me. I wake to find myself lying in the middle of a deep hole in the ground. My family are surrounding the hole digging more and more dirt so that it becomes deeper. Quickly i act and climb out as fast as I can. I dont know why they were digging. It was as if they just wanted a good work out because they held drink bottles and sweat towels and they all patted each other on the back saying 'good job'. This is so confusing I think to myself. Its like god has given me a second chance on life and has granted me another. I am filled with happieness and joy because I can see my family again. My mum and dad are walking back to the car from the hole and I yell at them to look. They turn around and see me. mum! dad! I say, crying because Ive missed them. They look at me suprised. At that very moment I freeze. Shocked from what is happening. They dont remember me. They dont...remember. I try to explain everything. My heart pounds like a thousand drums. please remember, I cry. Look, my mum says,We dont have a daughter. I look them in the eye, forcing them to know who I am. They drive off and leave me there all alone.", "Hi Okay so for a long time now every night I have been experiencing really vivid, intense, and seemingly long dreams. Whenever these occur, I can not seem to wake up, even if the alarm goes off at 8am, I sleep in until 1 or so. In these dreams everything is so real. A lot of the times danger is invloved, or a threat to my life and the ones I love. When I finally wake up, I feel exhausted and can remember every detail. The nights where I dont dream intensly I can wake up in the mornings fine. I have always been someone who remembers 99% of my dreams. Is there a dream/sleep disorder that would cause this? The inability to awake during intense dreaming. My husband says sometimes he tries and tries to wake me but cant. And there are times i hear him, but because im dreaming i cant really wake up all the way, and go back to the same dream. Thanks!", "So I was at this water park and then I went down a giant slide and my bathing suit got ripped off on the slide and I was stuck at the bottom of the slide completely NAKED in front of the whole water park. And then all these news copters and reporters came and kept videotaping me and taking pictures. It felt so embarrassing until finally I woke up.", "Such dreams have been coming up very frequently now and that is disturbing me. My dream starts off like everything is normal. I am usually in my house, and everything around is just as it is in reality. And I feel like I am awake and this all is happening for real. But slowly strange things start happening and I realise that, wait.. It's a dream! I get so f------ scared! And suddenly my body gets locked up and I want to, but I can't shout for help. I so badly try to escape that situation. I feel like some very strong feeling takes over me.. I try to get over it to wake up! And finally when I wake up, there is this strong vibration that comes through out my body.. and I end up in Panic!", "Why is it that everything I think or dream of or envision me doing never comes true its the opposite of it like for example im 17 and a senior i was going to play football this year i went to the summer work outs and everything i made the team and during the summer i would always see myself playing real good in the games being a star and well basicly just playing in it but on the night of our first game which was the jamboree my coach came to me and told me i was inelligable because i missed too many days last year and they cut my credits short so i didnt pass 5 out of my 6 classes. Another example is when for the first time i got a call back from a job i had applied to i went up there for an interview and after that they said they are going to give me a call back so i started dreaming and envisioning me working there and my friends seeing me and i had money but i never got a call back or nothing and i still jobless because every time i would apply for a job i would do the same thing invision myself working there and i would never get the job. And this didnt just start happening to me ever since i was little i would invision me doing things and when it actual comes down to it its something diffrent i never know why i googled it but i never got a answer just other peoples questions being answered. Heres another example: i was dating this girl and i would dream about her being faithful and everthing because all my past relationships i got cheated on but come to find out she was cheating on me too im not that ugly looking or fat. so why does this happen was it because i drempt about her being faithful or was she bad from the start and i didnt just dream of her being faithful it was all my girl friends well most of them an they all turned out the same way by cheating or they would break up with me for no reason. and RIGHT NOW FOR SOME REASON I AM INVISIONING THIS GETTING READ BY SOME ONE AND ITS THE BIG TALK OR SOMETHING BUT I KNOW ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN NOW THAT I INVISIONED IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING I INVISION OR DREAM ABOUT NEVER COMES TRUE AND IM WRITING I CAPS SO THIS PART COULD BE SEEN WHICH ITS NOT SO IM BASICLY DOING IT FOR NO REASON. But back to my original question why do evertime i think of something or invision something good for me it never happens or turns out the wrong way!!?? answers please but doubt it..", "I had a dream the other night that i was teaching a class of elementary age students. They were asking me great questions about my profession (which was not teaching) and i was able to give great responses. As I began to walk away with my grandpa and friend i see a guy hanging from a tree with the rope around his neck. at first i wasn't sure if it was a halloween decoration or a real person. i pointed it out to my grandpa and he tried vigorously to cut the guy down, he was real. Finally after trying every rope and every branch the young man (college age) fell out of the tree. He was alive. some other things happened in my dream but it ended with the boy who was in the tree going surfing and died while surfing....", "I'm a college student and this weekend I decided to take a four hour trip home. I returned fairly exhausted and the night after I returned I had a dream where I got onto an elevator. As it went up I just couldn't seem to catch my breath whatsoever. I don't know how long I went without breathing, but it felt like an eternity. I panicked and desperately banged on the elevator door to get out and maybe catch my breath. As soon as it opened up, I stepped out as quick as I could, but the nightmare continued and I still couldn't breathe. I eventually woke up gasping for air. I thought it was just the dream, but I actually wasn't breathing at all. This is the first time it ever happened to me and I hope it doesn't happen again. I've only had a couple nightmares in my lifetime, and this was definitely one of them.", "Bedroom is space- alone, happy, calming.

I am super comfortable, as I feel each part of my body slowly relaxing, my body sinks into the mattress.

The two frequencies merging into a binaural beat becoming one noise in the back of my head as my mind slips into a lucid dream. I am in the middle of the jungle: spears are being thrown, men are yelling in different languages, their faces painted and their teeth yellow, wearing nothing more than what seems to be a loin cloth. The women being tied to ropes and whipped with hostility, followed by the shrieking of the vulnerable creatures. The green mossy vines hiding the swamp; I become one with the scenery. I feel my body slowly becoming noticed; the men see me, the animals see me. I have entered their world and I cannot escape. i am surrounded by all the creatures of the wild, I hear my footsteps as I’m running through the ferns; sticks breaking under my feet. My breathing becoming heavier and the men’s voices getting closer. Music is playing in the background-it feels like it is not even in the jungle, but somewhere beyond . fast drums banging and bongos booming. I trip over, and graze my knee on the rocks, I sense im close to a river as there is water trickling through the rocks, I turn around to see the predators start surrounding me once again, I have no way to fight, and no way to flight. The animals are creeping towards me; their eyes gazing as me like a fresh piece of meat. Their mouths drooling and the sharp teeth shining. They seem to have forgotten the feud with the men and work as a team to capture me. They are less then a metre away when a leapord pounces. I close my eyes thinking nothing else but wanting to be home, back in my bed, away from this chaotic place. A few seconds pass, and nothing happens, as I slowly open my eyes I realize I am high up out of reach of the predators and I am still rising. I am drifting away- my mind becoming blank, the visuals are disappearing and I feel graceful. I wake up, back in my bed, the adventure is a pigment of my imagination. Back in my bed calming my breathing down once more, I look around my room, and I can just make out the jungle I came from: the window blinds running down and shut remind me of the sticks and spears, and my walls; green.

My haven is my zone. I am happy here, I am safe. You might wonder what a lucid dream is: My intent is to put my body to sleep while my mind is still conscious.

In last night's dream, I am standing in a club. There are two other women there and we begin a conversation. A group of men appear and try to make conversation. I ignore them, and they leave. I walk up the stairs to different spaces in this club. It is dark, blue, red, and smoky. Most rooms appear empty but for a few clusters of people. I keep running into the group of men from earlier, but every time I lose my companions until I am alone. At some point in this dream, I realize one of the women from earlier is Lindsey Lohan and the other is her lesbian lover. I walk to get a drink and meet a woman with tattoos all over her body. She gives me polaroids to show my boyfriend and tells me to go home. The polaroids are portraits of people I don't know. Another point in this dream, I am opening an oven. My boyfriend is looking at the pictures and asks me where I got them from. I can't answer because I am cutting a baguette. We're toasting them with lentil butter and beef bone marrows for lunch. My dream house is large, kind of like a warehouse, and I have wood surfaces in my kitchen. Also, I burn myself making toast in the oven. I keep cutting baguette bread for the toast even though we have plenty. When I do speak, I ask my boyfriend to make a salad. Then I wake up as I'm plating the meal.", "Last night I dreamt that I was eight years old, and I was exploring this giant mansion. A beautiful blonde model was touring me around the mansion (it was her house), but when she went upstairs, I lost her. I was really disoriented in this giant house, when suddenly I realized that I had to go pee really badly. Somehow, I knew where the bathroom door was, but when I tried to open it, the door wouldn't open. Concerned and anxious, I turned around to see a real-life Ken doll, and as I asked him why the door wouldn't open, he smiled evilly at me. A wave of panic flew over me as I realized that I was trapped inside Barbie's plastic house-- from my childhood. I ran to another room, and in this room was a pile of miscellaneous toys, but for some reason I knew that the rule was I could not touch them. Still desperate for the bathroom, but unable to find a place to go, I woke up in anxiety.", "I am walking around Stanford and come to the dining hall. I head in, intending to get hot water for oat bran (as I plan to tommorow). On the way, I spot a bag of millet and decide I want to get some. I grab the bag and try to pour some, but there is a hole and a bunch pours out. I consider leaving the scene, but I decide I ought to clean it up/people saw me spill it and I wouldn't get away with bailing. Because of this, I get to the ground and start picking up the millet, additionally there is chopped green onion on the floor. I try to swee stuff up and I am slow, and a benevolent person shows me a better way. I am picking stuff up when I am stopped by my philosophy of neuroscience professor. In a very hogwarts like way he scolds me for my clumsiness and suggests to the other assembled teachers that I ought to be punished. He continues, also implicating a girl who had helped me clean up. I am flabbergasted but realize that the best course of action for me is simply to accede and go to the detention. In the other hand, the girl who will be punished as well, refuses to go along and self righteously asks what we did wrong. I respond in a mock sarcastic tone saying we transgressed horribly and ought to be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Earlier in a dream I was visiting a ski resort at low elevation right next to a confluence of freeways.", "I was out on a spontaneous bike ride with my roommate and a few other friends. They had decided that it was a good idea to eat some weed-browies before leaving and began to get a little loopy. My roommate ended up falling off her bike on multiple occasions, getting badly injured, but because of her cloudy mind, thought nothing of it. On one occasion she fell off her bike into a near by canal but came out of the water smiling as if nothing happened. The final time she took a tumble, she was traveling at 30mph along the highway with her arms and legs in the air yelling 'I'm alive!'... however, she hit a rock in the road and flew into a canyon that had suddenly appeared at the side of the road. Having seen this whole episode, I saved her from the canyon and called an ambulance, which took her to the hospital. At this point our roles changed and I was the one waking up in the hospital bed in plaster cast with two broken legs and a broken arm. After this happened, we came back to campus and I decided it would be a nice idea to make some cookies to brighten our moods. It was weird.", "I have a huge fear of oral presentations and I was supposed to present a research proposal to my class in the morning. I had a dream that I went to class and listened to everyone give their presentations. Throughout the dream I was trying to convince myself that if my classmates could present their proposals, then I could present mine too. I was also reciting my presentation repeatedly in my head as I waited for my turn to come. I decided to go last and when my turn finally came I felt confident about it. I started my presentation and I thought I was doing well but then everyone just started getting up and leaving! My presentation was so bad that it made people want to leave the room. I felt ashamed and hurt by my classmates and woke up feeling even more nervous about my presentation.", "A few nights ago, I found myself at my desk at home studying for a test of some sort. I looked out the window and saw that my house was in a large sandbox. Immediately, I opened the window to get a better look at the environment and a giant hand (which, for some reason, I concluded to be my brother's) came down and picked me up. At this moment, I woke up in a panic and, after a few seconds, realized that I had been dreaming. Then, I went back to bed and slept peacefully the rest of the night. For me the biggest question that emerged from this dream is how I knew that the large hand was my brother's even though I don't think I ever saw the giant's face.", "Right before getting into bed for the night last night, I was reading an article about the Price Middle School Shooting, which took place yesterday in my hometown of Atlanta. This story really stuck with me because I never would have thought that a school shooting would take place so close to where I went to school myself. Not only did this story of the middle school shooting trouble me as I laid in bed before falling asleep, but also in my dreams that night. In one of my dreams that night, I was doing yard work with my friend Harper for her parents in order to make money to pay for the carnival that we were planning on going to with our rowing team. While we were spreading mulch in the backyard, we kept finding guns and kept trying to cover them with mulch over and over again. And no matter how much mulch we spread, we just couldn’t get them to go away. Even after going to the carnival and having a blast with my friends on the crew team, I still went to sleep in my dream thinking about the guns that just seemed to be everywhere. When I went to sleep in my dream, however, I woke up in reality with a clear recollection of my dream about the guns and how it related to the article on the Price Middle School Shooting that I had read the night before.", "The first part of the dream I remember was being late to a NASCAR race, and trying to figure out what people do at NASCAR events. There doesn't seem to be much to watch or anything that exciting going on, and they don't get to watch crashes on replay, etc. (I'm not positive I thought of all that in the dream, but I was wondering why people go to NASCAR events) Then I wasn't late to the NASCAR event anymore, I was watching the World Series on TV, but my entirely family was getting ready to go to the game, and we were late (the game was on TV). I was almost ready to go, but I couldn't find a Giants T-shirt, so I was just looking for the shirt for a really long time and they were impatient, then I found one (or actually like 4 that were all different colors). Then while we were at the game the Pirates (who weren't originally in the game) scored a run and it was a really big deal for them so they had a parade.", "My dream started out in a hospital. I was sitting in a lounge chair in a doctor's office, and I felt fine, but when I looked in the mirror my arms were completely deformed because I had broken them The doctor was going to give me surgery, but when the surgery started I wasn't under anesthesia or anything. The doctor started cutting into my throat through my mouth and said he was taking out my tonsils. Then, I 'went under'. I woke up from the surgery and was bleeding everywhere. I couldn't stop bleeding and the whole floor was filling with blood. I woke up from this nightmare to notice that the water bottle I sleep with had come open and spilled all over my bed!", "This dream occurred about a month ago, but I still remember it quite clearly because the content threw me off. I am a Resident Assistant (RA) in a dorm on campus and one of my fellow RAs is also in this dream. The beginning of the dream is fuzzy - I have forgotten what it entailed. However, at some point, students are expressing grave concern, which then gave way to a general atmosphere of chaos and tension. I walk down the hall, and I realize that the reason behind the students' behavior is because my co-RA is waving a gun around in the doorway of a room. He seemed to be moving his mouth and saying things, but no sounds were coming out. Students were not exactly running for safety, but rather striding quickly away from him, casting backward glances at him. In the dream, I found out later that the gun he was waving around was unloaded, and that his behavior was probably triggered by his PTSD, a condition that none of us on staff were aware that he had. I can't remember how it was revealed that he had PTSD. I found this dream just incredibly interesting, because the co-RA in question is quite possibly the nicest, most selfless and caring person in real life (and to my knowledge, does not have PTSD), and yet here he is in my dream, waving a gun around...", "DROWSINESS IS RED ALERT is a phrase every single person that encounters Dr. Dement should know. From day 1 of Sleep and Dreams this year, this phrase was ingrained into our memories. But beyond its implantation into our brains was the anxiety associated with the lottery each class. The thought of getting up in front of the entire lecture and screaming such a phrase WITH the fear of not being loud enough and thus being booed is something that is extremely frightening to me and my friends in the class. Almost every class we discuss how we will freak out if our name is called, and to illustrate just how 1) ingrained this phrase is in our minds and 2) how anxious the thought of seeing our name projected on the board makes us, my dream: My friend Sydney takes this class with me. We are both freshman at Stanford and are both equally nervous about having to scream such a phrase. In this dream, or nightmare rather, we were all sitting in lecture. The room was slightly dark for some reason and it came time for the lottery. In large, black letters on a light blue background Sydney appeared. The moment she had been dreading had finally arrived, and Sydney stood up to yell the famous phrase. As she went to speak, her voice went silent. Just her lips moved. She tried again and this time her voice cracked. Of course, the entire lecture was booing her. On the third try, it came out clear but right after that I woke up laughing, because this may really be a dream that comes true!", "My dream last night (or at least my memory of my dream last night) began in my chemistry section in Room 267 of Mudd. I distinctly remember my TA and my two lab partners. My lab partners were the two girls who had been my partners the week before, though they had been randomly assigned this week. The other section members were there, but I don’t remember them distinctly. The room was somewhat distorted, with all of the students and lab benches on the right side of the room, but the TA was talking from the left side of the room. We were given a packet with instructions, and then we were each assigned an item that we had to bake something with for the next week, and we would be graded on the quality of our baked good. My group was assigned Cinnamon. However, the sheet had a question “Does one of your group members know how to drive?” and none of my group members did. My TA told me to switch groups, but I argued that I knew plenty of people who knew how to drive. I listed four people (who shall remain nameless here, but I remember their names, and they do have cars on campus in real life). My TA happened to know one of the people I named, and started talking about how she was a controlling bitch. I don’t remember the transition here, but the next thing I remember was showing up with bowls and baking supplies at one of my friend’s suite in Governor’s corner. The suite wasn’t like her actual suite, though; it looked like the inside of a Marriot Residence Inn. There were two people watching TV in the dark and drinking huge bottles of something, so we had to whisper. At first, we decided to make bread pudding. Interestingly, though, we did it entirely without bread. So I suppose it really was a cake, though I wasn’t aware of this discrepancy in the dream. At this point, one of my lab partners had disappeared and was replaced for the rest of the dream by one of the girls who lived in the suite. We made one vanilla and one chocolate batter, both which included cinnamon, and then swirled them together. I remember being very concerned that the chocolate would not taste good because we used Hershey’s syrup instead of real melted chocolate. I also was worried that the chocolate would overpower the cinnamon taste, which is what we were being graded on anyway. We also debated whether we should put the batter in teacups, but ultimately decided we should just put it in mini ceramic soufflé dishes. It was then time to present our food to the rest of the class and the TA. The judging was taking place in the suite, so everyone was coming in with their baked goods. One group had a cupcake with cupcake-shaped frosting on top of their cupcake, then a smaller cupcake on top of that, and it was all gold-colored. I don’t remember the specifics of the other groups’ baked goods, but they were all variations of cupcakes. Again I questioned whether the cinnamon taste would come through enough in ours. I thought we should have made a spice cake cupcake with cream cheese frosting. Then I remembered that spice cake gets rubbery after a few days, and watched a video on the mechanism by which it gets rubbery. When they started tasting our baked good, it transformed into a peach and raspberry tart. It still had cinnamon, though, so I wasn’t concerned. The dream ended without knowing the results, and just with me thinking that we should have made a cinnamon cupcake with pear compote inside and cinnamon frosting. I distinctly remember color in the dream, which is a new experience (or at least new observation) for me. The chocolate syrup was certainly brown, the teacups were all different shades of green, and the tart was bright orange and deep red, with a realistically pale crust. My TA was wearing a navy blue shirt. However, I do not remember my surroundings (either the lab room or the suite) having any color.", "In my dream, my cousins and I were eating strawberry filled cream cupcakes that were about as big as our heads and we ran out. For some reason we were in some kind of mountainous region and we ran out so we had to get more. We got on our random sled and went off huge jumps and made it through the mountains on this strange sledding course with huge hills and ramps and when we got to where the cupcakes were supposed to be, the strawberry ones were all gone and we were upset. My alarm then went off.", "One night about a year ago, I had a terrible and extremely vivid nightmare where someone was trying to kill me. I didn't see a knife or anything like that, but somehow I just knew. The whole dream was spent in panic running away from this killer woman, until my alarm clock woke me up. The nightmare was so vivid I remembered it when I woke up and all through the next day. That night, once I had gotten into bed and started trying to sleep, the nightmare started exactly where it had left off - in the same vivid detail and terror. I knew that it was a dream though, because I could still feel my bed and hear things in my house. The weirdest part was that I could open my eyes from the dream and see my room, but in the dream this would be the equivalent to me closing my eyes! While I could have probably consciously and willingly finished the dream, I was so terrified I made myself wake up and get out of bed. Occasionally I still dream fragments of that nightmare, but I always know it's not real, and I can still voluntarily remember the dream.", "Last night, I had a dream that all of my friends that I made in college forgot who I am. It was eerily realistic and movie-like: the dream started off from fall quarter, when I first became friends with people from my dorm and other classes. Although I knew that the main character in the dream was me, I saw myself meeting and hanging out with people, as if I was an observer. There were moments in the dream that actually happened, such as when I first became friends with Maggie (*Name is changed), when I went to my first Stanford football game, and when I went to San Francisco for the scavenger hunt. Everything was sunny and I remember tons of laughing and smiling, but not much more. Flash forward. All of a sudden, I guess it was winter quarter, the weather changed from sunny to rainy and dark. Really creepy. All the doors in my hall in my dorm were bolted shut and everyone's faces seemed paler, as if they all looked sickly. There was no laughter. It seemed like a scary movie, where fall quarter was the foreshadowing to the actual scary part of the movie. My friends started to slowly turn from outgoing and friendly to zombie-like and scary looking. I don't remember much else except for the fact that I knocked on Maggie's door and when she opened the door, she forgot who I was. Looking at me, I remember that I was the only normal looking person in my dream; everyone else looked like zombies. Getting scared, I remember running from room to room, trying to find my friends, but they were all changed and none of them remembered me. Flash forward again. Spring quarter, I think. The weather changed back to sunny and happy, but the people were in this weird mid-phase where they looked ALMOST back to normal, but there was that underlying zombie-esque physique still. Everyone was so busy, whether if it was because they joined a sorority/frat, were involved in tons of different clubs or activities, or crammed with work. It seemed almost like fall quarter, except everyone had changed together, became increasingly busy, and forgot about me. I suddenly switched from being an observer watching me experience this to actually experiencing the dream as a first-person. The moment I woke up, I remember running towards a forest, kind of like the forest that was in the forest scene in the Hunger Games. I woke up scared so I think I was trying to escape. Then I woke up.", "My friends and I were on our way to the world cup games in South Africa. On our way to our flight departing from SFO, we decided that we wanted to go through the Golden Gate Bridge (even though the way to the airport from campus is not by traveling through the bridge). The weather was overcast and so as the driver, I decided to stop at a small gas station/convenience store on the middle of the bridge to see how the weather was going to hold up. As I was getting a cherry coke slushie drink, I see news reports about a Tsunami that is about to hit the Bay Area, specifically the Golden Gate Bridge in 10 minutes. I pay for my slushie and call my boyfriend and my dad to come and help me out because the bridge was blocked so that no one could enter or exit the bridge. They both arrive in 2 seconds and we all decide to drive past the blockades to safety. While I drive I could see the large waves crashing against the walls of the bridge and water slowly rising to the level of the bridge. Some parts of the bridge were breaking. All of my friends, my dad, and I finally reach a safer place but the water is still rising. In order to reach the safe place, the person that was in charge of the area wanted my Barcelona jersey that I was wearing in return for entrance in the safe zone. There are stone stairs that seem to go to nowhere but I see many people going up the stairs for safety. The people going up the stairs seem like strangers but I soon realize that they were my grade school classmates who I have not seen in years. As I was debating whether to go up the stairs or not, I woke up from this confusing dream.", "I found myself wearing a suit and sitting in a large hall that reminded me of the scale you'd find in a Hogwart's castle. I'm pretty sure that I was channeling my inner James Bond because I was pretty sure I was on a mission to infiltrate this school and save a professor who had some important information, typical spy plot line save the world kind of stuff. The weird thing though was that the school was more of a giant labyrinth than anything and I think maybe some of the rules of inception were taking to effect. The hallways seemed to move around and I moved from room to room without using doors. I eventually found my way to a winding staircase only to find my target murdered. Mission not accomplished. Then I was whisked away to what seemed to be another mission because I was instantly in another room with a model who I had seen earlier in the week from a commercial I showed to a friend. She may have been a competitor or an ally I'm not sure but I distinctly remember her trying to conceal a crazily tiny knife blade so maybe more of a competitor. I never found out because the next thing I know I hear my mom's voice asking me if I had seen the recently released movie Chronicle and then I woke up.", "A few years ago when I was at a national swim meet (I'm a competitive swimmer), the night before the competition started I had a dream where I swam my 100-meter freestyle in 55.31 seconds and placed fifth. The dream was a bit peculiar in that I could see everything from a birds-eye view, much like what you'd see on TV (with commentary and everything!), but it was so vivid I could feel every movement. I told my parents and my coach about the dream the next day; all they said was huh. Interesting. The crazy thing was: that day - the day that the meet started and I swam my 100-meter freestyle race - I made finals. And that night, in those finals, I swam the race in exactly 55.31 seconds and placed exactly fifth. Just like the dream! Prophetic or not, it's hard to tell!"
